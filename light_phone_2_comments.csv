Hi Joe; today I ordert the Couples. It would be great if you can support .flac files! If there a little more rum; it would be great; bout 10 for Music is fein; then I can drive with my bicycle  to my Office with music all the way! regards Alexander,8 hours ago,
Hi Joe;I'd checked the ringtones in latest update: #1 art nouveau clock; #3 homage  Debussy sounds great; theirs slowly increasing volume; and rhythm; are valuable; being deep in thoughts.Ones are artificial: Would you consider to add some stylish nature sounds;  like rain drops; birds; hippos;.. ? Or ones played by analogue instruments?And what about short notifications beeps? And what about scheduling time notification scheme: sounds of silence; and rush days?Keep en-light-phone-ing:),15 hours ago,
Phone is looking great! Can't wait to get mine in the mail!!One question - how does the map tool work? Like what service does it use? I live in the rural south and some map apps aren't able to get me where I'm going some of the time. Only the big name apps like Google or Waze work 100% of the time. Just curious.Thanks!,1 day ago,
Hi; something looks incredibly different than the original design; and not in a good way. Have you changed something and not included it in the updates?  maybe the screen and overall look of the phone?,2 days ago,
Joe; I can't wait to get my hands on this phone. I am sick of social media and I want out ?. Can October be next week please? Thank you for introducing this beautiful idea and this awesome product. Two thumbs up.,3 days ago,And let me know if I can help in any way with this amazing project. Good luck and Godspeed!!!
"Hey Joe - I'm stoked for this phone. Three questions: 1) will LP2 have visual voicemail? and 2) will it support blacklisting numbers? and 3)  will it include a Do Not Disturb schedule? Thanks again & great workPS - Obligatory ""sorry if these have already been asked"" disclaimer",3 days ago,
Hi Joe! Thanks for answering our non-stop flood of questions. 1) Is there any way to search the comments? Hate to make you keep re-answering the same questions. 2) How durable will the phone be? I'm hoping to keep it in a (large) leather wallet; but obviously wouldn't want to damage it. 3) Somebody asked about an ebook reader; but I never saw the answer. Surely it isn't possible?,3 days ago,
Also; I know a lot of people have made this request; but I wanted to let you know as well; that the addition of other languages (Russian in my case) would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. I have never owned a smart phone; and am still using a basic phone; but those are being less and less supported these days; so I am looking forward to the Light Phone 2!,3 days ago,
Hi Joe. I have been following the light phone 2 for almost a year now. With the recent updates; I have become more confident in the successful outcome of this project. I have just completed my pre-order of 2 LightPhones. I have pre-ordered 2; thinking that it will be a great gift for a friend/relative. I understand the phone comes unlocked; so I assume that the 2 phones I purchased don't have to be on the same plan. Will my friend's phone receive same support; warranty (If there is one)?,3 days ago,
Good day Joe; will the phone support a spell checker or a dictionary for texting? Really looking forward to seeing the video update!,3 days ago,
Did your team raise the price since initial offering?,4 days ago,
Hey; Joe! I am very excited to be a backer and to soon be receiving the Light Phone 2! That being said; I begin my third year of college the first week in September; and I'd really love to receive the phone before then (it would eliminate tons of distractions; undoubtedly). Given that I originally backed this project in mid-May; would it be safe to assume/hope that I receive the phone in time to use for school? Thanks!,4 days ago,
Guys;Are the edges of the screen as defined as they look in the new pictures?!From the videos of the phone when it first came up; it seemed be whole front was the screen and that 'box' wasn't there. Was that just the LP1?To be honest it looks nothing like whatvi thought it would; those lines are so off putting; which breaks my heart.I figured it'd be like when the qwerty pops up and it's the whole screen; not in that little square screen?Bit gutted to be honest.,4 days ago,
"Might I suggest (in the company effort to be ""minimal""); that the developers get together with the ""North"" company (Focals by north).https://www.bynorth.com/focals I have their glasses; that are SUPER minimal and love them!Their glasses  provide minimal HUD information (texts; basic driving directions; etc. - things that the LP2 are now incorporating)... but; BECAUSE both are ""basic"" and ""minimal""; it seems like a perfect pairing.Both of these together truly remove ""extra"" distractions!",4 days ago,
The new photos look good. One question: are the numbers and letters on the light gray phone a pure black? Or are they just a dark gray? They don't look as distinct as the ones on the black version.,5 days ago,
Hi Joe. I recall you saying that you'll soon be reaching out to backers to confirm their colour choices. When that time comes; will I also be able to change my order from one phone to the two for $500 deal? My wife has decided that she also would like to reduce her digital footprint with an LP2 (she's a mindfulness teacher; so that makes sense); and I'd like to be able to get her one. Please advise; cheers! -- Ross,5 days ago,PS - I just saw that a number of backers are asking the same question; so it would seem I'm not the only one with an interested spouse ;)
I have my solution for digital minimalism. In addition to getting a LP2; I bought an iPod Touch 7th generation. I am using it primarily for my mp3s; Spotify; and audiobooks; for reading news articles; sports scores; and weather updates; and for my alarms. When I don't need those functions; I can leave it at home. By downloading audio files; I can leave it offline most of the time when I am using it. Until I get my LP2; I'm using a ZTE 433 for taking and texting (which I always carry).,5 days ago,Another benefit of this is that the battery lasts longer between charges on my iPod Touch than on my iPhone as it isn't always pinging the cell network and my ZTE 433 goes about 10 days on a charge. No more frantically looking for a place to charge my phone everywhere I go.
Same here - Is there a way I could upgrade my current perk / preorder to the couples perk?,5 days ago,
Hey there again!Is there a way I could upgrade my current perk / preorder to the couples perk?Would be super nice!,5 days ago,
Hey Joe! Really excited for the launch of this beautifully designed phone; I would just like to ask a few questions and I apologize if you have addressed these in the past; do forgive the laziness of not scrolling through 1660 comments ? 1. Will there be a calendar function where you can create and save events and set up reminders of said events along with attaching details about where the event is taking place and perhaps a link to the direction app telling you how to get there?,5 days ago,"2. Is there going to be a Notes tool where you can create separate archives for different types of notes and tasks. 3. Will Arabic be a supported language in which you can receive and send messages in Arabic? Cheers from New Zealand!

No problem; a search function would be greatly appreciated Indiegogo team! We do hope to offer a calendar/reminders like tool in the future; it's not in our immediate priority list so I'm not exactly sure yet what the functionality will/won't be. The notes tool as we imagine it at the moment is quite simple and does not have different archives; but it's also something we can potentially explore. For receiving messages yes; but currently there is only an English keyboard for outgoing messages.

We do hope to offer more global keyboard language support; but as a small team we want to be realistic about what we can achieve for launch. Thanks for understanding!"
Looking forward to getting my phone.  One thing that I really appreciate my smartphone for is the e-tickets/boarding pass & QR code for flying.  Might it be possible to implement this as a feature?  When you are designing a case; can you also please implement a raised hard edge lip .  I have always had a belkin one and have dropped my phone so many times but have never had a broken screen as it never falls flat on the phone :),6 days ago,Hi Cameron; Thanks for the feedback. We have certainly taken note of such a tool; a few others have also asked about it. It's not on our immediate priority list; but certainly something I can see us exploring in due time. The case we're designing does have a raised lip with the intention of preventing the screen from breaking when dropped. Thanks!
Thanks for the updates; really can't wait to receive it! Sorry if this has already been explained but can you tell me what will happen if the glass smashes?  Is it especially tough or can we get replacement glass in Europe? Maybe it's an idea for v3 to move away from glass.  Thanks and keep up the great work! :),6 days ago,Hi Chris; The glass is pretty tough I will say; but it is glass after all. I watched Kaiwei do some drop tests and was surprised at how well the glass survived. I think because the surface area is smaller actually helps it too. In the past when users have broken their glass; we offer a very discounted replacement and have them send us back the phone so we can repair the glass or recycle the device (depending on how severe the damage of the drop). If there is a V3; we're open to all possibilities
Don't be discouraged by the negative comments Joe; the final product looks amazing! Realities cause things to change from concept to production and you've made minimal concessions. I can't wait to have it in my hands. With people abandoning Facebook I think we're starting to see how modern technology harms and controls our lives; this phone could be the beginning of something big. Let me know if you could use any help from your fan base and I'm happy to contribute how I can!,6 days ago,Thanks so much for the kinds words and generous offer to help; it's seriously humbling! Can't wait to share our phone with you :)
This has probably been asked already; but will it be compatible with MVNOs? Im part of a family plan and others are considering moving to one on the Verizon network. Im concerned that I might lose the ability to switch the SIM card between my old iPhone and light phone depending on my needs.,6 days ago,The Light Phone II will work with MVNOs as well. That's essentially what our optional Light SIM offering is as well (Light as MVNO).
So if we already have a phone plan for example with Att that allows hotspot; LTE and what not all we need to do is transfer the SIM?,6 days ago,That is correct. If using an iPhone; it's also recommended from carriers that you toggle off iMessage in your iPhone settings when swapping as well. It may not be necessary; but it ensures that your messages will come to your Light Phone II and not accidentally to another Apple device like a laptop or tablet.
Hi; very excited about the phone! I was wondering if the directions tool will have a search function. Just something to locate the nearest gas station; etc.,6 days ago,"There is a search function planned for looking up the address or name of a place you'd like to get to. I'm not yet sure how well it will work with searching things like ""gas station""; but I'd like that to work too. It's still early in its development; thanks for understanding!"
Hi! I am so excited to use this. When should I expect to receive mine? I am in Singapore.,6 days ago,"We'll begin shipping in late July and continue fulfilling orders through August. Considering your pledge timing; I would expect a late August delivery. Thanks!!

Thanks Joe!"
For a UK user. How much will the phone cost per month to use? taking into consideration; the 30 for the phone its self; and then sim cards etc?I am a little bit confused,7 days ago,The Light Phone II is an unlocked cell phone; and it does require a SIM to operate. You can use any compatible SIM of your choice. Some users will use their existing smartphone SIM; swapping between devices; which has no monthly cost; and other users will get a dedicated SIM for the device. I hope that makes sense!
How long is a typical battery charge estimated to last as to talk time and stand-by?My son; daughter; and I are really looking forward to getting our LP2s.,7 days ago,"Hi Gregory; We don't have our final battery results yet. The prototypes I've been using (and abusing) are also running a lot of debugging software and we've also constantly working on optimizing the battery life as well through software too. We hope that in normal; light use; it can last at least 2-3 days. Talk time I believe is estimated at a few hours; so long calls will have pretty significant impact on the battery; but the battery being smaller than smartphones does charge quite quick too.

We'll share our final battery results when they are ready!

Thanks!"
Hi Joe; being a fan of light for almost a year now its really difficult for me to back out. But unfortunately things change and so does situations. I would like to have a refund since I wont be able to go ahead with LP2. Whom should i contact in this case?,8 days ago,support@thelightphone.com please; thanks
Hello; this is taking to long and the original product is not met in my opinion. I want a refund.Erwin Traas,8 days ago,No problem; please email us at support@thelightphone.com and we can help; thanks again for the support of our project.
I thought earlier that the phone would only be able to be used on GSM carriers in the US; not on Verizon but I see Verizon on the Coverage page; just to confirm we will be able to use the phone on Verizon correct?  Second question; will wifi calling be available?  I have pretty bad cell coverage inside my house so wifi calling would be much preferred.,8 days ago,Hi Christopher; Sorry for the confusion; I believe the information you are referring to with GSM carriers was in relation to our original 2G GSM Light Phone. The Light Phone II is 4G LTE and compatible with Verizon. We do not yet have a wifi calling option but exploring how that might be possible.
If I understand correctly; the operating system of the phone is a stripped-down version of Andriod. Do you know if it sends any kind of telemetry/diagnostic/location data or Google or to anyone else? How many servers does the phone talk to?,9 days ago,"*to Google. By the way; personally; I couldn't care one bit about how the phone looks. It's not a fashion accessory; it's a tool. It stays in my pocket until I need to use it. 

There is nothing that we share with Google or anyone else. We will have a privacy policy (and other policies like warranty) ready prior to shipping; we're wrapping those up now FYI. In a previous update we mention our software updater doesn't use 8.8.8.8 which is common and sends information through Google. Instead we're using much more secure 1.1.1.1 - More info here: https://1.1.1.1/ ."
"The shadow of ""seam"" looks deeper than the alpha phone on #16 update. Is it just because of point of view or; modified for some reason like durability?",9 days ago,There have not been modifications. The depth of the shadow is caused by the front light layer which sits between the e-ink screen and the top glass.
@Andrea Corbetta lo schermo  cmq un po' piccolino per mettersi a leggere libri.,9 days ago,
Tra le applicazioni giuste per il light phone penso a: 1) eBook reader; 2)  pedometro; 3) traduttore 4) spotify,9 days ago,
Phone is looking great! I have some questions about the music:Will I be able to plug in my lightphone; mount it and just copy over files like a flash drive? That would be ideal. I've seen you mention a wireless web interface before. Even when I have my laptop I'm often in the middle of nowhere without wifi as I imagine many of the backers are so this would be a bit inconvenient.What types are supported? flac? :)Music takes up a lot of space - does the phone have storage specs? SD upgrade?,9 days ago,"Thanks; Trevor. Initially I don't think we'll have that plug in functionality; but we've started to mock up an optional desktop app for the phone that could allow you to text through your computer keyboard and potentially drag files as you mention. Unfortunately; I'll be the first to admit; it's not a music player device first and foremost. It has a max 8gb storage and we'd likely limit how much of that music player could use to maybe 4gb. We don't know what file types yet...

...but considering how little space there is; flac likely won't be a great option. (although in my testing I did get a HiFi-Man little flac capable standalone music player; that's been pretty cool). There is no external storage slots of the device either. Sorry if this news disappoints; it's really more of a playlist/shuffle than trying to be the best music player  ever if we're being honest about it. Hope that makes sense and thanks for understanding!

Ok no problem - my ipod classic is still going strong running Rockbox.Hopefully this desktop app will run on Linux!

I looked into an iPod classic for myself and couldn't believe how they maintained their value this many years later!"
Would be great to have gradual alarm ringtones. I like to awaken peacefully rather than forcefully. Starts the day better.,10 days ago,"That's great feedback too. Maybe it can be an option to be able to crescendo any of the ringtones. I remember trying an app called ""rise"" for iPhone a few years ago that embraced that concept and it was quite nice indeed. It seems appropriate for the Light Phone. Will see what we can do; thanks for the feedback."
Hi Joe;My wife and I think they look great! We're super excited. Just curious about plans. How will the major carriers be treating LPII? Will they consider it a smartphone or basic phone? Also any chance there we can get extra data through you without going fully unlimited? Ideally 2 GB is what we would want. Thanks!,10 days ago,"Hi Jordon; We are working with the carriers to make sure our phone will be accepted on their networks (some like Verizon don't let the SIM work if they don't recognize the model of the device; called an IMEI number). There should be no problems there. In terms of how they see phones; well a lot of them stopped supporting 2G phones; which is many of the classic ""basic phones"" and any new basic phones; including ours; use the same 4G LTE network of smartphones. Many carriers I believe offer...

...voice and text plans with very little data which would be suitable for the Light Phone II and likely a lot less expensive that a smartphone plan which would need much more data to support the various apps and such. We might be able to offer more data in such a fashion; but the way the pricing shot up for us with data; unlimited was nominally more expensive than 2GB I believe. I'll talk it over with our operations team and see what might be possible.  Thanks for the feedback."
I think the phone looks great! Let me just say that I think you guys have been extremely forthcoming; open; and honest about the design and its limitations which you have been working to minimize. But; it is exactly what I want in form and function... hey; that's just me though :)Also; I have recently ditched my smartphone completely. It was strange at first; but I am enjoying my newfound freedom! Can't wait to get the LP2 as my new tool to carry me through this journey :-) Cheers!,10 days ago,"Thanks for the note; David. Amazing to hear that you made the jump away from the smarpthone; can't wait to get you a Light Phone II now. I can personally say I can't imagine going back to a smartphone myself. Even for some of the minor inconveniences of using various degrees of functioning prototypes ha.

Thanks; Joe! And yes; I imagine that's been quite an experience for you haha. Testing and also using prototypes in different stages of development. Glad I'll get to use the finished product after all of your rigorous testing :)Cheers to you and the team; Joe."
Hi guys I have a question and Im sorry if its been asked before; will the LP2 have a screen lock that will require a code to access the phone and messages? I would like to see this as a option as my girlfriend is really nosey and I know shell be looking through my messages if I leave the phone laying around lol; also does the phone ship with a free case? A case with a single bank card slot on the back would be a handy useful feature for the minimalist. Great work guys; phone looks the nuts!,10 days ago,Hi Jonathan; Yep; there is an option for a 4-digit passcode lock for the phone. We are developing a case currently that we expect to be an option to add when we send our confirmation emails; but it will likely have a small additional fee. We are still working out the pricing; but we plan to make it as affordable as possible. I'd personally love to be able to offer it for free to our backers; maybe that will be possible after all; but I can't promise that yet.
Could you post a photo of the phone in landscape; showing the qwerty keyboard; and perhaps a video of someone with normal size hands typing a text?  Thanks.,10 days ago,Over the next two weeks I'll be shooting a lot of stuff with the phone for various assets on website; support documents/manual etc.;  so I'll make sure we have this stuff included as well. Cheers
Love it; it's perfect.,10 days ago,Thanks; Justin!
I know this isn't the original intent; but I am curious if it will be possible (and seamless) to switch my Verizon sim card from my smart phone to the light phone and back as desired? I may not always want to unplug completely. P.s. I actually like the look of the black (night) light phone design; personally.  Sorry for all the haters.,10 days ago,"Hi James; Yep that's actually how we imagine many users plan to use the Light Phone II. One recommendation we have for iPhone users is to toggle off iMessage when swapping SIMs to ensure all of your message send to the Light Phone. Thanks and can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you!

I actually have an Android (Motorola z2 play); but I imagine it will require a similar process?Thanks and glad this is the case!"
Hey Joe; thanks for posting the update!  I'm pleased with it; and have a few remarks.I love the look of the black phone; but I'm not a fan of the white model.  The edges of the screen really pop.  But I doubt the photos do it justice.  It's difficult to judge design without seeing and feeling the phone in person.  I've bought devices that look great in photos that look terrible out of the box; and vice versa.  And the fact that this phone is so small makes it even more difficult to judge.,10 days ago,"For example; the rounded back looks significant; but considering the phone is less than 9mm thick it must be more subtle than it appears.  Consider posting some photos of the phone next to some common objects.  I feel I could better appreciate the scale and design with that context.Lastly; market the heck out of this thing; man!  I'm really rooting for you and your team; big fan of your vision and community engagement.  And I'd like to see you guys grow.

I'm imagining; a long ways off; several models with upgraded designs and different features to entice even more people to go light.  Wanna go light; but need emails for work?  Here's a model with a lighter email client.  Want to take photos?  Here's a model with a camera; perhaps even a color screen.  A guy can dream eh?It's been a pleasure observing this process for the last year; and I can't wait for it to ship.  Thank you Joe.

Indeed it's hard to really tell a lot from the photographs; it'd be so cool to have a show and tell and be able to pass them around to all of our backers. The rounded back is quite subtle in my opinion.  From some angles the photos we shot it wasn't hardly visible at all; which we did want to make sure we showed it. Also the scale of the phone being that it's so small is really hard to judge without context as you mention; so we'll be continuing to share a lot more context photos...

... I love your enthusiam and support; we're currently trying to shoot the next week or so a lot of photos/videos that we can use to share with backers but also press and flush out a new website we've been working on for beyond Indiegogo. I also appreciate you sharing where you can see this thing growing into; it's really humbling. Thanks for coming along for the process; it's been quite the journey to say the least :) Can't wait to get you your phone!"
Hi; I'm extremely bummed to request this as I was so excited for the phone but can I have a refund? You guys did nothing wrong; I just am required to have a smartphone for a new job.,10 days ago,Of course; we totally get it. Hopefully our paths cross again one day :) If you can just email us at support@thelightphone.com; we can get that processed for you. We appreciate your support regardless!
Thanks for the update... looks and sounds beautiful!,10 days ago,Appreciate it; Alex; cheers!
Im actually liking the look its very retro looking. It would have been great to have a full edge to edge display; but that is a difficult hurdle with a custom eink display like that one.  I think the phone is great and the retro look makes it stand out from other phones on the market.,10 days ago,Really appreciate the note and can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you. Thanks!
When the Light Phone 2 ships out; will we have the option to start a Light Phone plan and receive a sim card at the same time?Thanks and really looking forward to having this phone!,10 days ago,Yep! We're going to send a confirmation email to all backers in July to make sure we have the up to date address; color preference and model preference (we'll recommend one based off your shipping region; but you can choose either model - North American or Global). At that time you can choose to add a SIM; extra cable or protective case as well. You can always reach out for a SIM at any point as well too if you don't choose it at shipping.
Re: John's request for pics of the phone with reversed colors. I'd love to see this as well. The black phone with a light screen would look really fun next to my Kindle. It'd be like a little sibling. Quick question though: does it reverse the lock screen as well? I'd love to keep it black when not using it for aesthetics; then once I unlock it; it switches to white for readability.,10 days ago,"I just double checked and it does not reverse the lock screen; only when the phone is awake. Great question though! (I will take some pics of that for you too)

That's such exciting news. You guys are doing excellent work. Super looking forward to the next update. "
I'm shocked and disappointed at the negative response. I think it looks awesome. Sure; the grey model suffers for having a more visible shadow; but it's still a cool option. Black reminds me of my old Zune and I couldn't be happier about that. It's insanely difficult to build a phone; much less one so different and with so few resources. The team should be proud. Reminds me of Pebble in all the best ways. I'm so excited to receive mine and only use my S10e for a few unavoidable work tasks.,10 days ago,Thanks for the note Tom; really really excited to share the Light Phone II with you! Hope your weekend is going well; cheers!
"this new screen design looks like shit.  HUGE disappointment.  Why is there all of sudden a HUGE blank space where the screen should be?  What happened to full ""matte"" face?  The 2000's called and wants their phone back.",10 days ago,"Just saw shipping is now October.  Good lord.  I read up on the screen design blog; fair enough.  

Well sorry to have disappointed you. I'm not trying to defend the phone's design; you have every right to hate it; but we made what we think is the best example of an E-ink phone considering the limitation of that technology. Shipping for new backers pledging today is estimated for October; shipping for our earliest backers starts in mid/late July and continues through August. We'll be shipping the phones out weekly until we fulfill all pre-orders; sorry for any confusion there.

And if you'd like a refund we have always offered a no strings attached full refund policy because we understand the nature of launching a crowdfunding project for a product before going through engineering and development comes with many unknowns. I personally wanted aluminum backing and as hard as I pushed I had to accept it would not be possible; which was disappointing; but ultimately the phone still delivers on it's biggest value for my needs of being a simple phone without distraction.

Thanks for giving our project a shot. Overall we're quite proud and fond our weird little phone :)"
Not going to lie; I am slightly disappointed with the final product (especially the white one). The two tones make it look slightly cheap... also the lip on the casing vs the screen takes away from the initial minimal design that had drawn me in.I will be continuing with my contribution as I really admire the concept; however from an individual opinion... that is my thought.I will probably be changing over to the Dark Grey...,10 days ago,"Just out of curiosity; why is the screen smaller than the phone's body? Also; it looks slightly pushed back to the (1mm or something).

It's appreciated feedback and we see where you are coming from. I do hope and feel that when holding the phone itself you won't get the ""cheap"" feeling. We made a blog post in conjunction with an update when we started diving into the screen design and that talks more in depth about why the screen can't fit the entire front of the phone and how the front light layer offsets the e-ink screen below the top glass. Check that here: https://medium.com/the-light-phone/why-a-screen-eca598f37159"
Hi Joe; thanks for another awesome update. Really appreciate the detail you put in these!I think in one of the earlier updates you mentioned you could reverse the colour of the screen via the software. Would it be possible to see some images with the dark grey phone using the reverse out screen please (white background and grey text). I'm really torn between the two colours; as the light grey version looks like it will be easier to read; but the dark grey looks more pocket friendly! Thanks,10 days ago,Thanks John! Yep; in the settings there is an option to invert the screen colors. I'll try to include some of those; good point. Hope all is well :)
"Joe; These phones look great! They look about the size of the iPhone 4 (which I always felt was the perfect size). Keep up the great work! (If it's a little later than August; I don't mind. Sometimes things need a little more time in the oven!)Question: I see the word ""streaming"" there. When I hear that I think music and podcasts; but I know those are future tools. What tools will stream in the launch period? Thanks again!",10 days ago,It's actually quite smaller than the iPhone 4; but I did like that size as well :) There are not any tools that will stream just yet in the launch period; I just mentioned that streaming would not be supported with our basic SIM plan because it requires much more significant amounts of data to be upfront about that. Although it's not really something the phone can do yet anyhow.
"Che dire! E' molto bello. Era prevedibile dovesse esserci uno stacco tra il display e-ink e la cornice. Ho scelto il bianco e penso di confermarlo. Sinceramente apprezzo molto il vostro sforzo per rispettare tempi e caratteristiche tecniche di questo detox phone. Vorrei chiedervi ancora in merito alle ""utilities"" che avr a disposizione. Aspetto i prossimi aggiornamenti! Sento che lo amo gi profondamente! Potete anche farci avere qualche immagine con la illuminazione attiva? Grazie",11 days ago,That's a good idea; I'll shoot some photos with the screen light on for the next update; sorry that slipped my mind! Thank you for the kind words and support :)
I think the phones look really nice! One question though. After listening to the sounds i wonder if there is possibly to have both sound and vibration switched on?,11 days ago,Yep! vibration I believe is always on if the sound is on.
Hello it is possible to change color?,11 days ago,Of course! We'll be following up with every backer in early July to confirm your address/color preference/model (region) and also offer our case and additional cables at that time as well. Thanks :)
Hi Joe;I really enjoy the ringtones; Light and Cosmos give me chills in the best possible way.Question regarding the music player. I know you are still making progress interfacing with Spotify. Until that point though; since Spotify is my only source of music; will there be a way to pull song files from Spotify into a playlist on the Light phone? If so; will you provide instructions on how to do that?Can wait to get my hands on the final product!All the best;Nathan,11 days ago,We'd love to make that possible with Spotify for users in your position; which is many of our backers; but until we get support internally from Spotify we can't offer it on our own unfortunately. We'd need a deeper access to their backend. We are trying our best to get the idea spread internally through Spotify; but they are in a pretty tough situation as a company themselves it seems and it's been hard to make much progress there. Hopefully after we launch; we'll have more luck.
I'm impressed that you are able to make the side bezels as thin as possible considering the limitations of e-ink technology. This phone represents a new category for those who need smart capability on their phone without the excess that smartphones creates. LP2 makes sense unlike other e-ink phones that are just smartphones with an e-ink display. Maybe when this technology improves; the possibility for an edgeless display might be a future project for the LP3. Looking forward to see videos soon!,11 days ago,Appreciate it John!
Hey again; I guess I should of also ask; if you have a WiFi connection & and let's say no singal on your light phone; could you make a WiFi call? Or alternatively send a text over WiFi?  I looked around but couldn't find an answer through the old updates.   Thanks again.,11 days ago,"Hi Colin; I don't think so at the moment; but I agree that it seems like it could be possible and we would like to explore it at some point. Sorry to not have a more concrete answer!

That's alright. I was thinking it could be used as travel loop hole so to speak; some companies you can buy/rent personal 4G hotspots; so if your phone didn't work in say whichever traveling country you still could connect to a backup hotspot & receive WiFi from it to use the directions; send a text or make a phone call over WiFi. It would give your phone an extra feature that's still in the ""Light"" realm. I think it's definitely something your team should look into. Thanks again Joe!"
About the ringtones in the last update: they sound quite round and mellow (and not only the vibes and marimba). I wonder if they will cut in a loud urban environment? I write as a sound designer and composer. I hope youre testing not only in a quiet room but in the middle of Manhattan during rush hour.,11 days ago,Really appreciate the feedback; that's a totally valid concern and I see your point. Will definitely take that into consideration with testing. We can always add more too; so that list is not set in stone by any means. We're very open to suggestions as well if you have any references/descriptions that may be interesting to explore; thanks Eric.
Nice to see the final phone photo. while not fan of mismatch contract on the white definitely obviously off. making it hard to decide and plastic not fan off remind me of my old window phone 532. however dimension wise definitely smaller than iphone se and will have try get used to bump curved back. overall should be exciting to own a minimal ink phone. maybe one day we get a phone like first light phone credit card size with 4G and texting etc. will the shipping provide tracking,11 days ago,Thanks Lorenzo; we do plan to provide tracking for the shipments.
Even more excited about this now! The design is different; but I love it! Has the retro vibes (like my old Gameboys); without looking like a cheap piece of junk. I think the design matches the goal of the phone very well! Anyway; I have two questions:1. Any updates on the case mentioned in previous updates?2. Will there be an opportunity to change our mailing addresses before shipment (moving end of July)?Honestly; you all have done a great job. This can't get in my hands fast enough!,11 days ago,Thanks!! We're currently waiting for the the tooling of the case for our first samples; and it seems like we're still on track to have them ready to ship with the phones. Will keep everyone posted. We'll actually require a confirmation response from everyone to confirm their shipping as we presume many have moved over the past year; so you should see an email from us in the beginning of July asking for that. We'll also post an update asking everyone to check their inbox :)
How exciting to see everything coming together!Those vibra-tones are really tugging at my heartstrings. What you're showing is here is beyond perfection. I rebuke those mourning the visible bezel and say that I'm very eager to hold what seems to be the most honest phone possible; made by a team who so obviously cares for their product and its impact. One million thanks!,11 days ago,Really appreciate the note and so glad to hear you're enjoying the ringtones!
Hi Joe; Thanks for sharing an amazing update. Its a good thing there will be an option to change the color of the phone later. I am not so convinced with the White color option though. Nothing wrong its just not what I expected. Id rather stick with the black one. So I might change in the confirmation email. But overall looks great.,11 days ago,Thanks Ali!!
Hi Joe; sorry if this posts twice... Would the Light sim card work with a smartphone/nonsmartphone that supports a nano sim card? This is a scenario I would hope to avoid; however if by chance my lp2 broke in a way that made it unusable; would I be stuck with a sim card that is incompatible with a backup phone until I could get my hands on a lp2 replacement? Thanks!,11 days ago,The SIM is not limited to the Light Phone II per say; but it has very limited data in trying to keep it as cheap as possible; so it should work fine in a non-Light Phone; but likely not for much other than calls/texts. Hope that makes sense; great question I hadn't thought about.
Thanks very much for the update; Joe.  I think the phone looks great.  I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on it and leaving behind all the extraneous stuff my smartphone does whenever I choose.  Keep up the great work!,11 days ago,Really appreciate it; David; thanks :)
Hey Joe I have been following this campaign for a while & I can say I'm very excited for this phone & I think it looks great!Im curious though about traveling with this phone. I live in the US(so region A makes most sense). But if I travel to Japan or Europe; the region A phone won't work because antenna bands don't match; correct? Or could the region A phone still work but just spotty service. & I suppose changing to foreign/travel SIM card wouldn't help the internal service.,11 days ago,"Hi Colin; We are hesitant to say that it will work because different regions do use different bands; however it may get some coverage outside of its optimized region. It really depends on a case by case basis likely. You could try to see if the bands of the North American Model (bands: B2; B4; B12; B13; B17; B25; B26 ) happen to overlap with the carrier in the region you are traveling. In general we are hesitant to say that it will work internationally though; unfortunately.

It's alright; and I understand it's a bit of a unknown area. I can always keep my older IPhone as a travel phone; or just buy a cheap travel phone. Normally when i travel I don't want to on my phone; it's just for emergencies. Thanks again for replying. "
Great update Joe and the rest of the team. Excited to see more updates; any chance of a video walkthrough of the functions? Otherwise keep up the great work; its fine that it looks like an outdated iPhone...eye roll. Not every phone needs to be edge to edge; I personally like the rounded back; but Im sure it wont matter with the light case for protection.,11 days ago,Would love to share a video walk through; planning to shoot a bunch of stuff using the phones over the next two weeks; but wanted to get this update out asap so people could see the final phone. We knew there would be some backlash unfortunately to that fact that you can see the active screen area; and to be honest; I don't even completely disagree with that; but having gone through the process I can at least confidently say we tried everything possible :) And I'm loving it in real life!
Yes. I see what people mean. From the photos you posted; it does not look like you have achieved a  great  match  with the screen and bezel.  People were expecting something almost invisible to the eye. And; of course; the visual impact of the mismatch is exaggerated with such an extensive bezel. It might be the photography thats the problem I guess. Perhaps more shots (and moving image) of real phones being used in different lighting conditions might help.,11 days ago,Different lighting conditions and angles certainly make a difference for the better. We wanted to show honest photos of it; we aren't trying to bait and switch anyone; we went through 8 months of trying every possible recipe and material; working with experts from other e-ink projects and we can at least confidently say that we think this match is closer than any other e-ink phone/product we've ever seen...which is admittedly still not a perfect match. Look forward to sharing more photos/videos
Thank you for the latest update; showing off the final product in all its glory! Unfortunately it hasn't made my decision any easier in regards to the colour hahah :)I sold my Pixel 3 a couple months ago and looking forward to this phone which will respect my time more.I think they both look great and I can't wait to see how they look and work in video. Joe and the team; you are all doing an amazing job; just make sure to take a holiday or extended break soon; definitely well deserved.,11 days ago,Really appreciate the kind words Lee. I'm actually still torn myself too ha. Looking forwarding to continuing to share more of the phones. We have some shoots planned next two weeks and we're working to now start flushing out videos and images for the support documents/manual; so a lot more details to come shortly! Hope all is well :)
I am unfortunately in the same boat. I was really excited about the Light Phone's aesthetics as well as functionality. I realize that the screen would be visible; but I didn't realize it would be that starkly visible. I'm also not liking the rounded back; which is now plastic (when did that change?? I must have missed the memo. In the end; it looks like an outdated iPhone.,11 days ago,"Sorry Arthur; we really didn't mean to disappoint anyone. If you'd like a refund please email us at support@thelightphone.com. Thanks again for giving our project a shot; we truly tried everything we possibly could to make it the best; small; e-ink phone.

I understand. You guys are doing a really difficult job. I will wait for some more photos of the phone in various light conditions before I decide.

I understand. In certain light conditions the screen is certainly less obvious; but we also wanted to be accurate in the photos as to not oversell the phone. The screen is more visible on the light gray version than the black version. The curve on the back was necessary for a bigger battery because we were afraid our initial spec wouldn't be sufficient for our users; I believe that was the August update; and it also mentioned about no more aluminum back; which I also really wanted personally.

The nature of launching a crowdfunding campaign for a product prior to going through the development process is very tricky with many unknowns. Thanks for giving this project a chance; seriously appreciated regardless of whether you end up deciding to keep your pledge or not! Best; Joe

Ah; one thing I had forgotten to askdoes it have a vibration motor?

Ah; sorry. Scrolled through the comments and found my answer."
This looks nothing like what the initial mockups promised. Bummer. Its lost all its edge-to-edge flair we were expecting. Big bummer. :-(,11 days ago,Sorry Jared; we really didn't mean to bum anyone out. If you'd like a refund please email us at support@thelightphone.com.
I was hoping that the phone looks more like in the promotional video; more like the original lightphone... Having seen the new pics I have to say that I don't like the design; it seems thick and old fashioned; in addition the hump on the back is horrible. When I look at it; the feeling is the one I will have looking at something cheap; made with bad quality materials. I hope I can change my mind because I love the idea that lightphone represents; but for the moment I'm disappointed...,11 days ago,"I don't know what to say Marc; I do appreciate the feedback and of course we too wish the screen could take the entire front face of the phone; but that's the reality of the technology we are using. We've tried really hard to explain this over the past year of updates (see: https://medium.com/the-light-phone/why-a-screen-eca598f37159 ). I'm sorry that you are disappointed; that bums us out too. We've tried everything we possibly could to get the phone to this place and we're quite proud of it...

... We will of course offer a refund if you are not satisfied (just email us at support@thelightphone.com). The phone referenced in the beginning of the campaign video was the original Light Phone and I guess we didn't realize how confusing that would be to our potential backers; we were just trying to explain the arc/history of our project. Thanks again for giving us a shot; we do appreciate it.

The original Light Phone was amazing in its size and design; but we had to admit it fell short in terms of functionality and we made this version to address those shortcomings. It meant a slightly thicker phone and that it would need a screen. Thanks for understanding!"
Hi there - will the phone work on the Verizon network and/or other GSM providers?,11 days ago,"Yep; it will work with Verizon SIMs; we're currently in the process of certifying the phone with their lab which will be complete prior to shipping any phones. In the US; it will work with pretty much every carrier except Sprint which has the least amount of compatible networks with our phone. Hope that makes sense!

Thanks Joe - what about Google Fi?

In theory we should be completely compatible in terms of network bands/antennas. We tested it with a Google Fi SIM that was set up using a smartphone device and it appeared to be working; but we want to understand more about how one would set up a Google Fi SIM for Light Phone II because they are not very clear about supporting devices not listed on their website. Sorry to not have a better more concrete answer there yet."
Is the frame of the phone final? I prefer very much the design in the campaign video  which looks just like paper with no screen frame. The current design looks like a cheap phone....,11 days ago,The photos in the update are of the final phone and its screen. I believe the phone you are referring to is our original Light Phone perhaps; which did not have a screen. I'm really sorry for any confusion there. We tried our best to explain this in the previous updates and blog (see: https://medium.com/the-light-phone/why-a-screen-eca598f37159). We understand this may be a dealbreaker for you. We can offer a refund if you email support@thelightphone.com.
"love the right tones !!Question: will be there other plans? $30 month seems high for a phone meant to use as ""secondary"" phone and to disconnect from all. A prepaid plan would be a nice option.",11 days ago,"It's a valid question for sure; and we tried our best to make it as absolutely cheap as possible (quite high monthly costs to keep SIMs active). Our plans are really targeting users who plan to use the phone as their primary device. For secondary phone users it may be cheaper to get a second SIM through your existing carrier; or simply swap your existing SIM to Light Phone. Hope that makes sense and thanks for understanding!

Thanks. In relation to a question above; what other providers the phone will work? T-Mobile? Sprint?

Pretty much every carrier except Sprint in the US. We've tested Verizon ATT and TMobile. Sprint may work for some regions; but it is the least compatible and we're hesitant to recommend it for our users."
Once again; things are looking great! Now that we're at the final stages; I was wondering if the final phone dimensions are the same as reported in the old update?95.85mm long x 55.85mm wide x 8.75mm thickThanks.,11 days ago,Thanks! Yep; those are still the correct dimensions.
Thanks for the update; photos look amazing! Ringtones are refreshingly unique :)Are there also going to be shorter ringtones better suited for text messages?,11 days ago,"Thanks; Noah! Yep; we've made a bunch of ""alerts"" too as we're calling them internally; and a lot of them are based off of samples from the ringtones.  Ringtones repeat until the call hits voicemail or is rejected/answered and alerts just play once when receiving a text or other notification. Cheers!

Awesome; keep up the great work!"
All aboard the hype train! Choo choo.,11 days ago,:)
Hey joe; We are close to july and im excited for the phone to be shipped whoooo. I remember i emailed you about in display fingerprint reader like samsung s10 or vivo or oppo phones and linked a webpage about it. You never got back me. Would it be possible to add a form of biometric on LP2 or future phone.,12 days ago,Hi Lorenzo; It's not going to be possible to add any sort of biometric to current LPII; but anything is possible for a future phone (although we're not actually thinking about one yet). Cheers!
V. Impressed with your project and really looking forward to the product. I have just had an enforced period of of no Android phone and it has been a revelation. I am looking forward to a mobile phone; mms and alarm clock only. Email and the rest is consigned to lap top/tablet. I plan on keeping my smart phone (P20 pro) as a standby for business trips overseas and photography as I love the camera. It can be used as a small tablet (tidlet??) and reserve phone. Keep up the good work.,12 days ago,Thanks Paul; I love hearing about how our users plan to integrate the phone into their lives. Appreciate your support!
Joe: Hey! Keep up the great work over there. I was just wondering: what's tech support going to be like after launch? Say we receive one that has a problem; who do we go through? Side note; if we are in the mood to tinker; say replacing that 8GB storage with a 32GB; would that be possible? Could I pay a little extra for the memory and get it custom on mine? (I know that's prob wishful thinking. Thinking of all those podcasts I listen on the commute.),12 days ago,Hey! We've currently in the process of building out a small support team as well as a manual and troubleshooting tips. If for some reason your device is defective we will certainly replace it for you. We plan to be as fair as possible as we seriously appreciate our early backers in helping us make this a reality. Unfortunately I'm not sure it will be possible to easily upgrade storage space; I wish I had a better an answer there as I do see where you are coming from.
What bluetooth version will LP2 have? Will it support AptX or AptX HD?,12 days ago,It's bluetooth 4.2; I'm not sure about Aptx or AptxHD; I'll need to refer to our engineers for that one. Thanks!
Yes yes yes... im happy for my order. Ok for music player; navigator; calculator; weather etc. i think NO SOCIAL but email account YES because in necessari for work today!,12 days ago,
Here's a suggestion for anyone who's concerned about moving from their smartphone to an LP2. Two months ago I bought a Nokia 3310 for $60 new. On weekends; I've been swapping out the SIM from my iPhone into the Nokia and using that as my primary device for a few days at a time. Obviously the 3310 is no LP2; but it is minimalist enough and has been helping me to wean off the iPhone and ease into the transition. For only $60 it has been a worthwhile experience to validate my LP2 purchase decision.,12 days ago,"Appreciate the suggestion; it's really great to learn about how users plan to use the Light Phone II. Kaiwei has been doing a similar balance with his Light Phone II and swapping SIMs and it seems like a great way to use the Light Phone if you don't want to go immediately ""cold turkey"" so to speak. Cheers!

Thx for the reply; Joe. It's my intention to reduce my digital footprint drastically; so the LP2 will become my primary phone. Just a personal preference. BTW - it is so very cool that you take the time to respond to many of the comments here. Much appreciated...

Thanks :)"
Hi Joe;Cant wait for the phone! At some point could you touch upon how your experience was going from a smart phone to Light phone? I have plans but would love to know how you did it and also how other people plan to use the Light phone! Thanks!,13 days ago,Yeah I'd love to share a blog post with more specific details; that's a great idea. I'd also love to learn how others plan to use the phone too and share some of those examples as well. The experience has been liberating to say the least. I don't find myself craving anything in particular in the smartphone; but I did notice a change in my general attention span that is probably related to years of smartphone use that was eye opening. Slowly reclaiming that feels amazing. Hope to share more soon!
when's the next update?,13 days ago,We posted our last update about two weeks ago; you can see all our previous updates here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2/x/17193706#/updates/all
Hi Guys  Will my micro sim I use in my iPhone fit/work in the LP2? Am on EE in the UK btw  Thanks!,14 days ago,The Light Phone II needs a Nano SIM. The model optimized for UK (and everywhere else outside North America) uses the following 4G LTE bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28. Hope that helps!
I know that the Light Phone 1 used a cross-platform desktop app. Will the Light Phone 2 also have a similar way to manage settings? It is important to me to be able to manage my phone from my GNU/Linux machine.,14 days ago,This time because the phone uses 4GLTE and also has wifi available we are able to do it wirelessly from a website we're calling User Dashboard. The initial Light Phone needed to be plugged in for such updates and used the desktop app as a proxy to speak to the cloud. Hope that makes sense!
Joe;Will we be able to buy more Lightphone2s after they ship? Looking forward to ordering 2 more if there first one is golden!What is the expected production to look like?Thanks!,14 days ago,"We do plan to continue to sell Light Phone II well beyond our initial batch for backers. We are producing more than our current pre-orders; so there will be some available after we ship to everyone; but they may also sell out (hopefully!); in which case it would just be a matter of weeks before a new batch was ready. Hope that makes sense!

Thanks Joe!"
Hey guys; new question: Do you think you might add support for WhatsApp at some point? I'm not personally interested; but I just shared your Indiegogo page with a friend and he said if the phone supported WhatsApp he'd buy one right away.,14 days ago,HI Javier; We've heard that feedback from other backers too. We're open to exploring it and/or other messaging platform like Signal that could allow for more international or encrypted calling/texting solutions; but it would certainly be quite the undertaking and require a pretty deep collaboration with their teams which is a little out of our control. It's not our immediate priority at the moment; thanks for understanding and taking the time to share that feedback from your friend; cheers!
Does LP2 support Uber? Uber is available in more countries than Lyft.,14 days ago,We'd like to support Uber as well as Lyft and maybe even other more specific local ride-sharing tools in due time. SO far Lyft team has been incredibly supportive; so it is possible that Lyft will be the first option available; but that is still a work in progress. We do understand Uber is more suitable for our larger international user base than Lyft and want to be as universal as possible. Thanks for understanding.
FYI https://rubishops.com/product/light-phone-2-minimalist-4g-phone/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIg7KPw5DN4gIVRESGCh3GnwU0EAkYASABEgIjp_D_BwE another fake LP2 Seller,15 days ago,Thanks yeah we saw this one; unfortunately because someone had purchased from them and then reached out to us. We've filed with the FTC and hope to get all of these scammers shut down asap. Cheer; Ben; thanks!
Hey Joe! Excited to hear about the navigation update. Will the navigation use Google Maps or something else?,16 days ago,We haven't come to a final decision; but Google Maps is one of the options we'll explore and it seems pretty robust in a lot of ways. We'd want to ensure that we could pull from Google Maps without any tracking side effects.
So can we expect final production pictures and a more so finalization update in the coming week?,16 days ago,Yep; that's the plan.
@Joe HollierRe: emojis; can there be a sort of alternative keyboard with ascii/utf-8 based text emoticons instead of graphical emoticons? (Similar to iOS Japanese - Romanji options.)With foreign character set support; you may be able to have more emoji options with what you may already have baked into the software with little effort! (),16 days ago,It may be possible to do something like that. We'd like to support alternate keyboards in the future so that it's a better experience for some of our our international and multilingual backers; but for launch we realistically only expect to have a standard english keyboard available. Thanks for the suggestion though!
Hey Joe! I'm been a backer for over a year now; and I become more excited with every update that you guys post! I just wanted to say that I definitely advocate having a forum for the Light Phone II. My suggestion would be Reddit! :),16 days ago,"Whoops; just saw that you already have one! Nevermind ;)

We do? I'm not personally a reddit user; but open to any suggestions for platform we might be able to use.

Probably user-created. https://www.reddit.com/r/LightPhone/

thanks!"
"Hi; Joe! I'm so excited for this phone; and can't wait to finally get it in my hands. Thank you so much for making such a beautiful ""dumb phone"" :) Btw; does the phone have the capability to display emojies in text-messages?",16 days ago,Thank you for the kind words! Incoming emojis will be displayed in b&w; but there is not a way to send emojis.
How will the LP2 handle group messages?,17 days ago,Yep!
Hi Joe; would like to start by saying thank you for the creativity and effort to make the Light Phone. I've been a backer since Jan/Feb and have been super excited to ditch my smartphone for the LP2. However I just read the phone will not be supported on Verizon; can you confirm? Unfortunately if Verizon cannot support; then I will need to pursue other minimalist phone options; or wait until the LP2 is supported. Sorry if this has been explicitly posted somewhere...thanks!,17 days ago,The phone is expected to work just fine on Verizon; I'm really sorry for any confusion there. Verizon requires any IMEI (the way they recognize phone models) to be certified with their internal lab in order for their SIMs to work in a device. We have been working with them to get that certification (they have 8 of our beta phones in their lab currently). Their team sees no reason why we will not pass our certification; I just wanted to be honest that it is a work in progress is all.
"Can you guys please give a summary of how the light phone plan sim will work? This is an answer I got back in February but the contract plans were not finalized:""We will be offering service for Light Phone II for around $25/month although our contracts have not been finalized. We hope this fee will include unlimited talk and text with 500MB of data and the option of porting your current number.""",17 days ago,Hi Andy; We will have a lot more details in the upcoming update; but it's still more or less the same. The price will liekly need to be $30/mo; but it will include unlimited text/call and simple tools (not tethering or streaming; which streaming isn't even an option yet). You can port your number or take a new one. The SIMs will be available in our address/color confirmation email. You sign up for the service when you receive the SIM itself and activate it. Cheers
Will this have the ability to use 2FA apps like Google Authenticator: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US. This is necessary for security at work.,17 days ago,We do not yet have any support for 2FA apps; but we have had an interest from other backers and it's something we've noted to explore in the future. Thanks for understanding!
Will the Lightpohne 2 work with the Austrian network operators (A1; Magenta; HoT; 3; ...)?,18 days ago,The international model of the phone uses the following 4G LTE bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28. If you do a quick search with your carrier you should be able to confirm that it's compatible; I do believe it is though.
What about after-sale support? Is a forum planned for sharing experiences among users?,18 days ago,A forum is a great idea! We certainly will have a small support team that we are in the process of hiring for :) We are also working on a variety of manuals/tips/troubleshooting for our users.
Does this phone have any sort of backlighting or does it need to be used with external light? Thanks,18 days ago,It's technically a front light (feels like a backlight still when using the phone but it's a piece of glass on top of the e-ink layer fyi); but yes; the phone will be visible in low light situations; unlike older generations of kindles for instance. There are three settings for the light; always ON; always OFF; or automatic which uses the proximity sensor to decide if the light should go on or not. Hope that makes sense!
Found on linkedin:Around 5;400 hidden app trackers operate on an ordinary iPhone; a Washington Post privacy experiment found over the course of just one week; using monitoring software. A range of trackers shared personal details such as email addresses and locations with third parties; particularly overnight; creating a trove of personal data for marketing and political messaging. While some apps require trackers to function properly;   ..............,18 days ago," the experiment raises concerns about the transparent use of consumer data.https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.37f8dfcb2a81FYI; I was not allowed access to the full article because I had my adblocker on. pretty hypocritical!!! 

Yikes! (and very hypocritical lol)"
Weve been watching this campaign for months and finally became a backer a few weeks ago. Apparently there was some confusion. We thought the phone would work on the Verizon network but we read in the comments below that is still in the process. Do you have a timeline for when you might know for sure if the phones will work on Verizon? Excited about this phone; but the other networks have spotty service where we live so we may need to reconsider if Verizon isnt an option. Thanks.,18 days ago,"We expect to have a final answer in a matter of a few weeks or less; the phones are currently at the Verizon lab getting tested and we see no reason to be concerned; their team assures us it should be no issue; we just wanted to be honest that it's a work in progress. If it for whatever reason there is an issue we can always offer Verizon users a refund of course. Hope that makes sense!

Perfect. Thank you. Will you give an update when it gets approved?

Maybe not a specific update for just Verizon certification; we'd likely include it in conjunction with other updates. We're given high confidence from Verizon team that it will not be an issue; and if for some reason there is an issue we were certainly let everyone know asap."
Hey Joe;I originally chose the black color but I think I'd prefer the white variant.Is there a way for me to switch?,18 days ago,Hi Joshua; No problem. We will actually be sending an email to everyone to confirm their address/color/model (region) and ask if they'd like to add an extra cable or case optionally; prior to shipping. At that time you can change your color. Cheers
Perhaps this has been addressed; and I missed it; but is it possible for the phone to have a white-listing feature; which would allow only calls from your contacts list to ring the phone; but no one else?,18 days ago,Hi Larisa; IT's only been briefly mentioned in the comments; but it's something we'd like to add as a feature in the settings. Currently (as of today) it's not yet there; but it shouldn't be a very hard thing was us to add; likely prior to launch if not shortly thereafter. Thanks for the suggestion!
Im sure this has been asked already; but... will this device be compatible with Google Fi?,19 days ago,Technically the bands of our antenna are compatible with Google Fi. We were able to make the phone work; but we set up the SIM using a Google Fi approved smartphone prior; as I'm not sure what their policies are for phones not listed on their website. But in theory it should work fine. We will be doing further testing with a variety of carriers; thanks!
Ive been told I will only last 3 months with LP2; but it will be nice not having all the apps and be forced to update any apps/iOS/features. Ive deleted all social media apps and its the best thing Ive done with my 6s. We dont need any extra stress in life. We all need more me time and time with our loved ones.,19 days ago,Having just about hit my three month mark; I cannot see myself going back to my iPhone SE. I still own it; and will sometimes use it on wifi or as an ipod essentially; but I've since gotten some dedicated music players for that. It's been interesting to see just how affected my attention span had become; it's not that I crave Instagram per say; but just I initially found myself less able to focus than prior to having a smartphone. It's really quite an experience; cheers!
Couple of basic functionality questions: 1) Will there be voicemail on the phone? I know the original Light Phone didn't have it. 2) How will texting handle pictures? Obviously gifs are out; but will straight photos render in B&W? Or will there at least be a symbol to let us know that a picture was sent? 3) Will we be able to block numbers? I get TONS of unwanted spam calls and blocking them is an essential tool; at least for me.,19 days ago,1. Voicemail for LPII is handled by your carrier. There is not a voicemail menu on the phone; but you can call yourself and use your PIN (at least with my carrier that's how it works) to read my messages; not that I actually do :) 2. Incoming images are currently displayed with a photo icon so you know it was sent; but there is no way yet to view/forward them. Blocking numbers is a feature yep!
How will the LP2 handle receiving emojis and images via SMS. I'm concerned about what happens when using the LP2 as my main driver and being unable to receive a picture sent to my phone and having no way to access it,19 days ago,"The phone will receive incoming emojis and display them in b&w. There is not currently a way to view/forward images from LPII; but being able to forward them to email (manually or automatically) is something we'd like to explore. I will say; after using the phone for almost three months now as my daily driver; my friends have learned to just email me photos/videos instead and I'm actually kind of loving it. I can see many instances where that could be annoying; but it hasn't been so bad for me.

I hope that a solution to this is implemented into the LP2. I used a dumb phone for a year and eventually switched to a Samsung S3 smart watch as my main driver because it kept the limitations but still allowed pictures. There were just too many cases that came up where I was unable to view something important in a conversation because of no pictures being received on the dumb phone. maybe the email is a solution but id much prefer seeing the B&W images similar to how the kindle displays them

Appreciate the feedback; we are certainly taking this into consideration."
Hi Joe;I know you might have covered this in any update or many backers have asked this before; but heres the thing. What happens to future support for Light OS? in terms of tools development and updates? Is there a plan in place or you will largely focus on the dashboard/site and leave it to the devs?,19 days ago,We do plan to support the phone ongoing; we've been actually growing our dev team to support more tools as well as continue to expand the OS (things like mutli-language support etc.) as well as of course making sure everything is stable and bug-free :)
"Hi there; and congrats on the project! I imagine it must be hard to keep things simple when ppl are probably asking for a million tools. I hope you manage to say ""NO"" often and keep the phone ""Light"" for real :)Slightly contradicting what I've just said; here go two requests:1) For the ridesharing tool; it'd be awesome if one could choose which company to get those rides from. I live in Buenos Aires and use Cabify.2) A simple countdown timer would be very welcome (I use it for meditation)",19 days ago,Appreciate the kind words and support! Saying NO is crucial for our phone and we'd like to encourage everyone to try the phone with as absolutely few tools as possible. We'd like to support a variety of platforms for things like rideshare; and hopefully it will not be too difficult for us to do so; but at the moment we are exploring Lyft and Uber fyi. Timer is a great idea too; thanks for sharing.
Really thankful for the 2 for 500 deal. With many smart phones costing the same as the Light Phone ll; I found it a bit difficult to commit but that deal really helped and motivated me to tell many people about the phone in my pursuit to have someone do it with me. I'm really happy to be a part of this and to bring a friend along for this transition into going light permanently. P.S. Also wanted to emphasize how wonderful it would be to have spotify!,19 days ago,Amazing; thanks for the support. We do realize that it's not a cheap phone by any means. I will also add from our experience even with the original Light Phone; when going light with someone else; there is much less initial anxiety or f.o.m.o; and it's nice to have someone else to share that experience with. A sort of accountability gets made. Cheers and thanks again!
Joe; I've been following the phone since the initial Light Phone 2 video; and I'm happy to be a supporter of this. A device like this is something I really believe in. I was going to give the MP02 a whirl; but the added tools here are more in line with my needs. I do have just one question: I work in a school building that has very spotty cell service (even with 4G). However; WiFi calling has been a savior for me. Will the Light Phone 2 feature WiFi calling and text? Or anything like  it?,19 days ago,Hey! It's a great question that I unfortunately do not have a solid answer for you just yet. I do not think that the phone currently uses wifi calling capabilities; but in theory it seems like something that should be possible; I'm just not personally technical enough to know what it would take.  We do have it noted as something we'd like to explore for the future; I hope that's not too inconvenient or unexpected. Thanks for understanding!
"Will the Light Phone II support any password apps like 1Password? Seems intuitive: it's a security-enhancing; non-addictive tool that works best when readily accessible on a portable; personal device. I consider this to be an ""essential tool"" that I would need to ditch my smart phone for good.Many thanks for all of the work and thought you've already put into this. May everyone one day replace their addictive smart phones with one of these--the world would be better and healthier for it!",20 days ago,Hi Vanni; Thanks for the kind words; really means a lot. There is no currently plans for any password apps; but we've heard a few other backers ask about it and are not opposed to exploring it in due time; but realistically that will not be until the fall. Appreciate the feedback though; and I hope we might have a solution thats suitable for your needs; we'd love to see everyone break away from their smartphones too and totally agree it'd likely make for a world with more peace of mind.
"1) Does this still come with a $10/month SIM in the US? If not; will it work with an AT&T SIM? 2) How does the ""Find My Phone"" feature work?",20 days ago,"Sorry for any confusion; but the $10/month SIM you are referencing (it used to be $5 even; before our prices on those SIMs doubled!) is from the original Light Phone. The Light Phone II however; being 4G; is more suitable with a variety of networks; including AT&T.  Find my phone feature is planned to work through the user dashboard website. A user would need to opt-in to find my phone with understanding we'd periodically ping the phone's location in order to provide that functionality.

Thank you for the answer! So; if I were looking to add it to an existing account would it just be a simple calling/texting plan? "
Joe; just wanted to say I had a similar reaction when I turned off iMessage and switched to Android a few months ago. I knew it was going to be difficult to do; but I really didn't anticipate all the problems that came with it with missed texts and such. So glad to be free. Also; are you still on track to share pictures soon of the final phones?,20 days ago,Yep; still planning to share that mini update later this week or early next.
"Before your Light Phone 3 and other versions . . .such as a Light Phone 1.5; complete your light phone 2 mission first; please! I just want a ""light"" phone but not a smartphone.",21 days ago,Of course John! Light Phone II is the only thing we're working on; don't worry :)
Request: when working on the weather tool; would it be possible to include the (for us survival-critical) local or location-searchable data on current/projected air quality? More than rain; when we head out of doors; is the need to know if we will be able to breathe upon arrival (especially during fire season).,21 days ago,"Data can be had from places like this: https://waqi.info/

Appreciate the thoughtful feedback and for sharing that resource. Definitely taking note!"
If the new Chinese import tariffs are any kind of a concern or financial/disribution threat; I know that I would seriously consider additional funding.,21 days ago,That means a lot; thanks Scott!
In keeping with Robbo Robertson's comment about a Light Phone 3 and other versions . . . How about a Light Phone 1.5? Contact & SMS & MMS handling of LP2; 4G (international compatibility); music/playlist management; but without GPS services. Maybe even a robust IP68 version or case? OMG take my money now; I really think you have found an untapped market/unrealized demand and I hope you keep at it for years to come.,21 days ago,Hey Scott; I can totally see where you are coming from; especially with such a robust case would be awesome! Just to be clear; GPS is always off by default; but actually it's an FCC/CE requirement that it's in the device for emergency calling (which is the only time it is used if you decide to not manually add any tools that would require GPS).
Hi Joe;Are there any updates on compatibility with Verizon?Thanks!,21 days ago,We're in the process of certification now; everything seems to be moving along fine; but it's not 100% complete process yet. Thanks!
I cant believe I just found out about this project! So excited to become a backer! This is everything I want in a mobile device and a perfect replacement for my aging blackberry. Only wish I had heard about it sooner and could get one before September! So excited! Keep up the great work!!,21 days ago,Thanks and cheers; Seth!
will the Light Phone 2 have a sd card slot for music storage?  or how much storage in the phone already?,24 days ago,"Hey Matthew; There is not any SD slot on the phone itself. The total internal storage is only about 8gb and we'd likely put a limit to how much the proposed music tool would be able to use (TBD). Stand-alone dedicated music players will have a lot more to offer; so it's not trying to be the 'best music player' in that regard;  but just a simple a way to have some songs to tune out on a loud train ride home etc. Hope that makes sense

FWIW; another option we were talking about; but haven't committed to or explored; was that the songs could be stored in your user dashboard (website/cloud) and that the phone would be able to stream the playlist from there. It'd give you the option of more songs; but require more battery/data and only work when you have service (i.e. not in on an airplane). I'm not sure that's something we will actually do; just fun to brainstorm the various options; cheers."
hope the trade war is not having a big impact on the plan,24 days ago,Thanks! It's definitely not ideal situation; but we're confident it won't have such a big impact that we can't fulfill our pre-orders in the same timeline. We have a few explorations for potentially moving our production out of China in the long term if things continue to get worse with the trade war. It seems like this trade war is going to have a pretty wide impact on a lot of industries unfortunately.
@RobboRoberston: Would love to see the light phone put a dent in these companies; wonder if anyone can get a figure on how many people have decided to step away from these brands. As of now they are on the same platform and do all the same functions ect.,25 days ago,This is amazing to hear from our backers; and I sure hope we can become a viable solution for enough users to break free from those companies. Light Phone is quite far from denting them realistically; but I think that there is a building general public distrust/frustration and there could be a tipping point for sure. For me to go full time Light Phone II prototype; I disabled my iMessage; and it was quite freeing . I don't think I realized how sort of trapped in their ecosystem I had become.
And another question - I realise once this is done you'll probably be wanting a long break... but do you have plans for a Light Phone 3? I would sign up in a flash. I'm sick of the other phones by the big boys; with who knows what going on in the background; with thousands of apps I don't want & terrible battery life. I'd really like a updated faster Light Phone. So just some encouragement to stick at it; and take on Apple; Google & Amazon!,25 days ago,Appreciate the encouragement!! We'd love to be something that can truly take them on too; honestly. I don't for see us taking a break realistically; as nice as that sounds; I think we'll have a lot more going on once the phones are in the world. Although we don't yet have plans to start a Light Phone 3; we'll be listening to all of the feedback from everyone closely and maybe we'll learn there is a need for a different version too. Can't wait to share the Light Phone with you!
Hi there; thanks for all your hard work. For those of us who just wanted a true 'light phone'; will there be a way to delete all these extra apps that we don't want?,25 days ago,"Hey! I love that you don't want any additional tools at all; a true Light Phone indeed. Even better than needing to delete them; is that they will never exist on your phone unless you manually add them; so you can just ignore the ""tools"" section of the user dashboard website where one would go to add their additional tools. The phone does ship with the alarm tool installed; but there is a way to delete the alarm as well.

Great! Thanks. "
Will military time be an option?,25 days ago,Yep; that's also how I prefer the time to be set personally.
"Hi team. I'm curious about the amount of numbers you can apply to a single contact? I currently dump all of my work contacts into one labeled ""Work"" solely for emergencies. I differentiate by customizing ""type"" of number to their names. This keeps my contact list clean and meaningful.",25 days ago,Right now contacts are limited to one phone number per contact. We were testing with if you import a contact with multiple numbers it would automatically create a contact for each number with the label at the end sort of like: Joe (home); Joe (work). We will also have a way to edit/delete your contacts in batch and it felt super nice to clean up my contacts; something idk if I had ever really done before.
Hi joe. You now support incoming texts in other languages. So are there plans to support text input in other languages(ex.Japanese; Korean; Russianetc.)?,25 days ago,We'd love to support input in other languages; but it's a much harder task than simply receiving the incoming; so it unfortunately will not be something available by our initial launch. It would need to be something that we work on in the future and add support in software updates. We do have some high level concerns around the small screen and we'd need to find partners to work with that are familiar with these other languages (as we ourselves are not). Thanks for understanding!
In the next update will we get to see a preview of the dashboard?,26 days ago,The next update right now will focus on photos/videos of the final phone samples and other details about the phone specs themselves. Likely the update after would cover the on-boarding & dashboard as well as sharing some of the support assets like manual/tips/troubleshooting etc. Hope that makes sense! Love the enthusiasm though!
Also; does the gps feature turn on and off automatically when using directions?,26 days ago,I imagine that's how it would work; yes.
Hey Joe; did you start Beta testing with real-world users yet?,26 days ago,"We have been in beta; but it is a much smaller batch than we initially anticipated and we are slowly ramping that number up.  As mentioned in update; the beta phones are still prototypes and not the ""final"" product that beta testers will be keeping and using beyond beta (minor aesthetic tweaks mostly). We've been also trying to keep some secrecy around it :)"
"Dear Joe;Firstly; I'd like to sincerely thank you and your team for all the hard work and spending countless hours  creating and finetuning this amazing product. I have raved about it to my friends and family.I have selected the ""Couples""option; but I would like to know; will you still sell Light Phone 2 through your website after the campaign/crowdfunding is over? I lose phones frequently; so I would love to know if the option to purchase them online later will be available.",26 days ago,Thanks Johann! We do plan to offer the phone for sale ongoing beyond fulfilling all of our backer's pledges; while supplies last we'll sell the remaining phones for our initial batch. We'll continue to produce more beyond the summer; it just may be a few weeks that we are sold out perhaps after getting all the pre-orders out while we make more.
What do we need to do if we changed addresses?,26 days ago,We will be following up with everyone in June and July to confirm their shipping address/color preference etc; but you can also email the change to support@thelightphone.com and we'll make a note on your pledge now. Thanks!
Just read in the latest Update; that Spotify is going to become a tool soon  Thats great! But Im an Apple Music user will it follow soonish? And regarding sound and quality what DAC is inside the LP 2? Is it capable of delivering a sufficient quality?,27 days ago,"Spotify still very much TBD in that we're talking to them; but it's a matter of proving to them why it'd be worth it to spend some resources to help make Spotify work for Light Phone II; but we are feeling pretty optimistic from conversations thus far. I just asked the team about details regarding DAC inside the phone; will get back to you. I am under the assumption regarding Apple Music that it is a completely locked to Apple products thing; but maybe that's not accurate?

Apple Music is as usable as Spotify. Its available in Sonos; you can get it on Android and Windows aswell. So its the same same but different. :)

You may be correct about that; we can certainly explore it; but I assumed that was in addition to having an iPhone; and I didn't think it could work if you didn't have an iPhone with the app store etc. Thanks for pointing that out!

Would be super cool!Im planning to go 100% light.Since music is a very dear thing to me and streaming is a thing now it would be super cool to have the ability to use my library as is and not have to switch the service or have to buy all the music to sync it via the light web app.I know that there are dozens of streaming services but it would be a cool thing if most common services (Spotify; Apple Music; Amazon) would be on the LP2.http://bit.ly/2I9UhDJCant wait to have my LP2!"
I was brought to tears! Ive had a smartphone for the past 10 years.  Im so tired of viewing my life through the context of my phone and my online presence. I just want to live I just want to grow. Even when I delete the apps; they always come back. Hours and hours of nothing. I know to some its not that deep but this is absolutely a beautiful God send. Thank you. I cant wait!,27 days ago,Thank you for the kind words and support Margot! Very glad our project has crossed your path. We can totally relate to how you are feeling about your relationship with your smartphone.
TL;DR; as there are so many comments; but do you have photos or even rendering of the two colors that are available for pre-order? The original white doesn't seem to be a thing anymore; so it's mostly curiosity. I know I will have the opportunity to confirm my color choice before it is shipped out; but wanted to check if there is source beforehand. Cheers!,27 days ago,Working on photographing them this week for an update early June specifically around the two color ways. Sorry we haven't been able to get this earlier; we're eager to share these photos with everyone!
@Lee Jarratt Point taken; but I use it more than texting. Again - why even have texting on the phone with your point? Having calling; texting; and email would allow me to just focus on those things and ignore all the other apps and things that come on smartphones. It's still going light. hahaI appreciate how the Light Phone team has worked to get a few tools on the phone that make it functional.,27 days ago,
Agreed with Lee and John about wanting to limit tools going forward; esp email. They're all optional of course; but even having something like email available seems antithetical to me. Also; I just noticed the delivery estimate changed to Sept. That's for new preorders; I presume? Current ones still on track for mid July-August?,27 days ago,Yes; the updated timeline is only for new orders; sorry for the confusion.  We have a hard line drawn for social media; news; advertising and email. I can certainly understand how email is important to some users; but email is not something we plan to include ever. Even if we felt differently; it still would be a very bad user experience on such a small device. I've also never liked email on smartphones either for both the sub-par experience and distraction.
"@Ethan Case. Would it be ""going light"" if email functionality were available on Light Phone? The reason I personally want to go light is the absence of this amount of connectivity and impulses to pull the phone out of my pocket.",27 days ago,
With all the additional functions backers are requesting to add features to this phone; I'm concern we are straying away from the Light concept. I would like to know if the internal hardware is powerful enough for these additional functions and will this effect battery life? Basically; what are the hardware specifications? Is it more like smartphone specs or does it lean towards smartwatch hardware? There must be a limit to what this device can do.,27 days ago,Hi John; There are some intentional limitations to the hardware that we believe will keep the phone from straying away from the Light concept. The small; e-ink screen makes things like social media; news feeds; email or games not really possible (not that we would want those anyhow). In terms of the hardware spec; the processor is quite powerful; battery is in between smartwatch and smartphone; but you also won't be scrolling videos/images. Using various tools will certainly impact battery...
1) Joe; I know I already pinged you about this - but is there any update on the email functionality for this phone? I would love to have email on it. With this added capability this phone would become my daily driver hands-down. I just need my email!! lol I use it more than texting haha any way the develops could make it one of the features?2) also what is the status on this phone working with the Verizon network?Thanks for all the hard work so far! Super excited! :),27 days ago,"There are no plans to support email and I don't think we ever plan to support email; sorry if there was any confusion there. There are tools like If This Than That (ifttt.com) that one could use to forward specific emails or just subject lines to themselves as sms messages. In all honesty; email on such a tiny device does not seem like a great experience. We are working with their certification team now; so far so good; but it's still going through the process.

Thanks Joe!! Looking forward to the phone!!"
+1 on russel-baker's question... What's up with the time line? is that for new backers only?,27 days ago,
Heya; absolutely love the latest update (glad so much basic functionality is added)... noticed that the shipping date just changed from July to September; but update still references the earlier date? Was there a delay for previous backers?,27 days ago,Sorry for confusion; it's hard to talk about the timeline in that we will begin shipping over a period of time; starting with our earliest backers in mid-July and fulfilling the remaining orders through August. For new backers (people signing up today) we are estimating September. Hope that makes sense
Hey; Just a question; will there be any storage expansion slots (micro-sd)?Looking forward to this.,28 days ago,Hi Lucas; There are not any storage slots in the Light Phone II. Also looking forward to sharing it sooner than later with everyone!
Hi Joe. I have a few things to ask that I don't want to post here... Is there a direct way to get in touch with someone from the team? Or should I just send an email to the support email address?Thanks,28 days ago,The support email is one shared by our small team so that totally works or my email is joe@thelightphone.com if you'd rather email me directly
I am super excited to experience what going light is like.I am from the UK; and I just wanted to ask what the process is that I have to go through in order to use my phone properly. For example; simcards? Phone networks? How does it work? Will I need to go out and buy a specific sim card?Kind regards,28 days ago,"Hi Josh; Thanks for the support! Depending how you plan to use the phone might change what you'd need (and we'll share more about this with everyone too). The phone does require a SIM; some users will simply swap their SIM between devices; some will get a new SIM for their Light Phone and have a dedicated 'light' phone number (like a work phone/home phone kind of balance) and others who plan to use only the Light Phone II will just need a compatible Nano SIM. As for compatibility...

... The international model; suitable for UK/Europe; uses the following bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28. It should be compatible with almost all of the carriers in the UK. I know we've been able to confirm that a Vodafone SIM worked flawlessly in the Light Phone II. A quick internet search should be able to tell you which bands your preferred carrier uses. Hope that was able to answer your questions; let me know if anything was unclear :)"
How is the touch screen responsive and accuracy; specifically when using the keyboard? Are you planning a continuous production of Light Phones after the campaign ends; as well as plans to bring them to stores and other such availability? Looking forward to new marketing materials etc.Hope everyone on the team is doing well; would love to see some behind-the-scenes stuff at some point :),28 days ago,Hi Lee; In general the touch responsiveness and e-ink screen responsiveness have been an ongoing process of optimization. The touchscreen is like what you'd expect from a smartphone; but the e-ink screen is not as fast to display (we're talking milliseconds) as an OLED screen. We plan to show some videos in a little update in two weeks.  We do plan to continue production of Light Phone and retail stores is an option for future as well. I'll be trying to shoot some new material too!
Thanks for the update; it looks amazing! Couple questions;1) Any hope of support for Verizon NumberShare?2) How are you gutting Android to reduce Google tracking?3) I used a Palm & the keyboard is miniscule! Any chance of opt-in voice dictation for LP2; maybe AWS Transcribe?4) Any chance of WiFi calling for home/buildings with bad reception? Thanks again and keep doing such great work,29 days ago,Would love for it to work with Numbershare; we think those programs (att and tmboile have one too) seem very fitting for Light Phone II. Yet to test ourselves; but we are working with Verizon on certification stuff now. There is no Google Mobile Suite in the phone or google tracking whatsoever. Voice is interesting thing to explore; especially for the small screen; but it's not in our current launch plan. I'd need to refer to our (currently swamped) engineers to understand wifi calling better...
Joe;Do you have plans to release the Android source code for us to tinker with?Thanks,29 days ago,"I don't think so in terms of full control of Android source code; but it's something I'd be open to learning more about what we can do there. I know there are a lot of licensing pieces and legalities; but that might be for the lower level hardware pieces rather than what you are interested in tinkering with. Sorry to not have a better answer there yet.

Joe;Thanks for answering our innumerable questions.I think youre right; usually if the Android source is released; the hardware drivers remain as binary blobs (often times).I ask for two reasons. First because naturally I look forward to tinkering; but it also would allow users who are asking for features you do not want to create and support (I suspect that youve seen a lot) to extend the phone in ways that best suits them.I really cannot wait to get my device; thanks again!!!!!

In general; we'd like to support users freedom to do that (create tools that we don't plan to build ourselves or feel comfortable sharing with other Light Phone users through our user dashboard). I think if you buy the phone and want to do something radically different with it; even if we don't necessarily agree with said feature for a ""light"" phone; I think a user should have the right to do so for themselves. Technically how we pull that off we haven't quite figured out yet. Cheers"
Hey Joe -- the latest update was great and the phone looks wonderful! Question about directions: will there be an image of a street map available or only turn-by-turn navigation steps? I generally only use maps when traveling and find turn-by-turn directions difficult to use without a seeing a street map first to orient myself. It might be hard to blindly follow a computer without being oriented and confident that the final destination is; in fact; where I want to be headed. Thanks!!,29 days ago,"...of course; it doesn't have to be an interactive/sophisticated street map (ie one you can modify; zoom; has business names; etc like google maps) -- just a simple jpeg of a grid or street map of the area would be super helpful. No worries if impossible; but if it's possible and easy to include it might be very helpful. Thank you.

Hey! Great question. For now we've been hesitant to show a map itself; but I totally see where you are coming from. It's actually something on our list to explore in diving into directions; and as you thoughtfully mentioned it wouldn't really be possible (lots of engineering resources and the e-ink screen experience) for live map navigation; but a static image of the journey might not be so hard to incorporate. We will certainly consider it; thanks!

Great; thanks a ton Joe! Hoping that this is possible and thanks a ton for just looking into it!"
Will there be a major ad when this is released? I show this to anyone interested. Have you thought about interviewing users after sometime to see how they have coped with making the switch? Would be an interesting for an ad or video on YT.,30 days ago,We love the idea of interviewing some of our users. For one; we're super curious ourselves what that experience will be like for everyone; what worked well; where there was a lot of friction etc. We'd love to share those stories too; but we haven't yet imagined them as paid ads; but rather interesting stories for our blog etc. Showing the variety of ways people can integrate a Light Phone II into their life could be really inspiring to potential users too.
Is the Light Phone 2's OS a pure proprietary software; or will there be service imports from Android or Google; such as KaiOS?,30 days ago,"I'm not entirely sure what you mean by ""service imports""; but the Light OS is something we've completely customized. There is no way to add any third party apps if that is what you were referring to. Hope that was helpful; please let me know if I didn't answer what you had in mind. Thanks!

A poor choice of words on my part; apologies. By 'service imports' I mean; a process/service running on an OS (such as GPS Receiver service; Microphone management service; Contact management functionality) that has imported (out-of-house/not-custom/non-proprietary; ie provided by Android) source code/library.

How much of the LightOS is Android software? Android; Google; and Apple all perform data mining for behavior modeling of the user. I am trying to discern the amount of privacy this device allows; especially as compared to feature phones without a GPS Receiver.

And; thank you for having the courage to make such a device. I share your sense of over stimulation and dislike of hyper connectivity. I've already ordered mine and am itching to get my hands on the LP2. All thumbs are all the ups."
"You've implemented non-English character support! Amazing! It'll be even better if those characters can be used in the contact list; too.Let me make one further request regarding this from my viewpoint as a Japanese user. While Chinese; Japanese; and Korean languages have a certain set of characters in common (called ""kanji"" in Japanese); there are regional variations in many characters in this set; which are aesthetically very important. It'd be wonderful if you could add such a distinction.",30 days ago,"The matter is discussed in the following blog post from Adobe: https://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/15/introducing-source-han-sans/

Thanks for sharing this information; very useful; especially as we continue to improve the phone's accessibility over time. We will try our best to continue to accommodate more localized language support; thanks for understanding!"
I'm delighted to read that there will be a simple calculator and that you've changed the default light phone DNS server to 1.1.1.1. I too don't like Google keeping a log of my every move down to the second.I have two remaining issues:  Will we be able to automatically forward to voice mail without ringing calls from numbers not in our contacts (as a means to avoid annoying rings from spammers) and is there any hope that the alarm clock will support up to four or five alarm settings at a time?,1 month ago,"Hi Gregory; We are exploring such a ""muting"" feature for unkown numbers; but we have not currently built it into the settings. It may be something included in settings for launch; but I cannot promise that timing just yet. Right now the alarm is still limited to just one alarm at a time.

Muting would be great. Just some mechanism to avoid spam calls is pretty vital to the concept of a ""light phone"".I understand your position on the alarm; but I seems such a simple thing to allow multiple alarms.  It's available in the Nokia 3310 and the ZTE432; both of which have far less computing power as the Light Phone 2. As an example of why this is important to some folks; I have 4 alarms: 1 for weekday wake ups; 1 for weekend wake ups; & 1 each for medicine in the mornings and evenings."
Will I be able to use a tempered glass to protect the screen?,1 month ago,I think it should be fine as long as the speaker opening wasn't covered and that the proximity/light sensor was still able to get an accurate reading (used for automatic screen light setting as well as when on a call and the phone against your cheek so you don't accidentally hang up).
The phone will really be amazing! Great job guys! However; I wonder how much storage there will be on the phone? How many songs is maximum?,1 month ago,There is a total of 8gb storage; but for music we'd likely limit the amount of storage that could be used for music. I don't know how to best estimate number of songs considering such variety of length and quality (file size of different types of songs i.e .wav or .mp3 etc.). I've seen estimates that 4gb can be between 600-1000 songs; but like I said there are many variables; thanks for understanding.
Can I get a summary of how the light 2 will work as a secondary phone? If I plan on fowarding calls from my current ATT phone; what will I need for the light 2? SIM card; separate carrier plan? Thanks in advance!,1 month ago,"Hi Ryan; We are planning a blog update specific to just this as I imagine like the original Light Phone; people will have different ways they plan to use the Light Phone II as a complement to their smartphone. Call forwarding is one option; the Light Phone would require an active SIM and  would use that unique phone number; and unfortunately message forwarding is not possible. If you were to swap your SIM you'd still get messages/calls and would not need a second SIM. ATT also has a program...

...called NumberSync I believe in which they offer additional SIMs that maintain the same phone number. We haven't yet been able to test this; but we're hoping these services may be suitable for some Light Phone II users.  I hope that makes sense!"
Following another comment; will we need to choose which region our phone is for or will to do that automatically?,1 month ago,We will recommend a model based of your shipping address; but you will have the option to pick whichever model you prefer.
Loved the last update. On the next update can you post similar photos of the light grey version with the black text. My kids are on the fence- and want to see more photos of the white version. Sounds like they have a chance to change their color choice when you confirm before shipping? Is that correct?,1 month ago,Hi Katherine; We are planning a side by side update within the next two weeks and yes there is still an opportunity to change the color. (we will send a confirmation email for address/color/model prior to kicking off shipping)
Hey! Could it ever be possible to access your light phone texts on your computer? Then you might be able to see photos; and access links that have been sent to you. I can honestly say I have no idea how any of these things work; but I was just pondering the idea...,1 month ago,Hi Diana; We would like to have an offering like this for sure and we have some ideas; but it's not going to be possible for our initial launch.  I do like the ability to be able to text with a full size keyboard on my computer. Security is a big concern with trying to sync to a website; so one idea was to create a desktop app that when plugged in was just an expanded view of your phone itself; and all the data would still live on your phone (not posing same security risks; but not wireless).
Glad to be back on board! I had to cancel my order and get a refund a few weeks ago due to my financial situation but things worked out in the end; and so I was able to re-contribute! :) Guess this means I probably won't get the phone as soon as I would have before though since I ordered last time in January right?,1 month ago,"Hi Geoff; So glad that things worked out for you and we have you as a backer again. I've made a note to the operations team; so you can take the place that you originally had. Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead :)

Wow thanks Joe! You're the best! Do I need to submit my old order number or anything or can the operations team just handle it all on their end? Hope you have a great weekend too! :)

Nothing needed from your end; thanks!"
Any chance there will be a non-GPS directions option? User can download a list; and can go to next step with a swipe/(some other hands free action) rather than tracking of current location by service like google maps. I don't really care if Google/tech companies(if google maps is used) has my data; but I think it'd be great for more people to have the option to not be tracked every second of every hour of every day. Great update!,1 month ago,Interesting idea; perhaps possible. We don't really want our users to be trackable and so part of our exploration of which platform to support directions will be whether we can do so incognito; so hopefully we can achieve your goal of not being at all trackable and still having a great directions experience. Incase it was not clear; the GPS will remain OFF when not using directions (also as it drains battery much quicker than when in stand by).
Hi Joe; I've been following your progress and am excited about the product. I have two questions:  (1) When I pre-ordered (Couples) I was not prompted to choose between the two available regions. Is it correct to assume that the phones that I will receive will be set for the region that accords with my mailing address? (2) If I have a North American region phone and travel to Europe with it; will it be possible to make that phone usable in Europe?  Thanks for bringing this to market!,1 month ago,"Hi! We will send a confirmation email to everyone to confirm their shipping address; color preference and model choice. We will have details about which model will work best in your region at this time; but still let the user decide which model they want (some users plan to use it outside of where they currently reside). It may be usable in some regions where the bands overlap; but unfortunately it may also get little to no coverage; which is why we cannot recommend it internationally yet...

... This was a hardware limitation. We spent a great deal of experimenting last summer in the early phases of the project trying to make one model that could work all around the world; but it was just not possible to have that many bands without severe interference unfortunately. Sorry for the less than great news there."
Just backed!I read on a tech blog that this can operate as a primary phone. Is this correct?  No call forwarding required?,1 month ago,Yep! Sorry for any confusion there; the phone can be used completely standalone as one's primary device. That's how I am currently using my prototype. Cheers!
Great Update.2 things1. Will there be the ability to use the keyboard in the vertical orientation? I have used a Fiio M6 which has a similar form factor & found the vertical screen usable. This would also allow one handed use.2. I have the latest Kindle Paperwhite and played around with having the text in white with a black background. I found it pretty much unusable. Was wondering if you found a way to make this feature truly functional?,1 month ago,"We don't yet have plans for the veritcal texting; but you make a point about being able to text with one hand; which is not easy with the Light Phone II. We did a brief test; it was mostly possible but it was quite small. Perhaps we will reconsider but for now the keyboard is only in landscape orientation. Curious what made it feel unusable to you; I have been testing a black prototype for two months with the screen inverted in that way and it's been working for me. Thanks!

When using the kindle. Having it refresh the whole page; b/c most of the page is black; every time; is jarring. It could be on a smaller screen it's less of an issue. But for the large screen of the kindle; it looked weird when it changed screens in inverted mode.I understand keyboard would be small in vertical. Just saying in my experience using a vertical keyboard on the Fiio M6; I found it surprisingly usable. Though I will admit; their were a few times I wished I could go horizontal."
update looks great! keep up the good work,1 month ago,Cheers!! Thank you :)
Hello; Light! Thank you very much for your time and dedication in creating this phone; and I appreciate the thorough and specific updates! This phone will make my life (and; I'm sure; the lives of many other backers) so much more deliberate and intentional! Will this phone allow you to store contacts and phone numbers? If so; how many will you be able to store? Also; will there be protective cases for sale/shipped with the phone itself?Thank you!,1 month ago,Hi Joseph; Thanks for the support! The Light Phone II does store contacts and there is no set limit to the number it will store. We plan to have one case (two colors to match the colors of the phone) available for launch that can ship with the phone. When we send our confirmation email to confirm your address; color; model you will also have the opportunity to add the case or extra cables then as well. Hope that makes sense!
Hey; thanks for creating this phone. I'm excited to use it! I am curious though about whether or not there will be an option  to silence select text messages (e.g. group texts you were added in that you don't want to get constant notifications for). :),1 month ago,"Hi Eli; We have the functionality to ""mute"" group threads. You will still see the message history in your recents; but it would not buzz/notify you for messaging in that muted thread. We don't have a ""mute"" for individual contacts; but that like all aspects of the OS could be reconsidered of course. Thanks!

Sounds good! Thanks!"
Nice update. Still absorbing it and not sure about the audio files upload for the music but overall it's good to see things coming together.,1 month ago,
@d'arcy it is a nano sim.,1 month ago,
Excited that I'll be able to choose my mode of transportation when using this phone for directions. One question I have is whether or not the Light Phone will read aloud those directions through its speakers or headphones. Apologies if this has already been asked and answered,1 month ago,Great question! It has not been answered. I believe in our initial scope for directions it was not planned to be included as a feature. I can see how if one is driving that could be really important so it's certainly a functionality that we can consider adding. Thanks for pointing that out.
Great update; will I be able to use my current micro sim card? I have a contract that runs through until November that I obviously would like to utilise.Ciao;d'Arcy,1 month ago,The Light Phone II requires a Nano SIM (smaller than Micro SIM). However you may be able to get a compatible Nano SIM from your service provider and utilize the same plan hopefully?
Hi there! I have a question; is the LP2 a GSM phone or CDMA?Thank you!,1 month ago,"The Light Phone II is a 4G LTE phone which is a universally accepted technology no longer divided into two versions like 2G or 3G was with CDMA or GSM divide. With 4G LTE all carriers use different ""bands/frequencies"" of 4G LTE. In the US our phone supports the following 4G LTE bands: B2; B4; B12; B13; B17; B25; B26. Hope that makes sense!"
Question....can band 71 be added later via a firmware update or is it too late due to the FCC?,1 month ago,The bands are fixed and I don't think we will be able to update them over firmware. It also; as you mention; would void our FCC/CE certifications I believe.
Want to join in the praise parade and say great job guys! Thanks for the update and props to the whole team for the work you're doing. I'm a previous backer who jumped back in... And I'm glad I did! Cheers!,1 month ago,Glad to have you back! Cheers
I'm curious to know if the bluetooth capabilities will allow LPII to connect with my Fitbit and receive text messages/phone calls. Thanks!,1 month ago,"I'm not sure yet; but I'm inclined to think maybe not (at least not yet). I think bluetooth is right now only used for audio; but maybe that's something we can support in the future perhaps.

Thank you for the response!"
Hey Joe; My question has to do with the messaging system. Will it allow for messaging in groups or just single person messages?,1 month ago,Hi Wendel; Yes; group messaging is supported as well.
Hi guys! To echo everyones sentiment; Im very excited about the phone. The last update was great. As discussed there; I know that Spotify and Notes are future tools that may be added. And while your team may already be aware of these options/ideas; figured Id send over a few thoughts. Re Spotify; perhaps the LPII could employ offline push functionality similar to the Mighty Vibe device (https://bemighty.com/products/mighty-vibe) - essentially allowing user to download and store the music,1 month ago,"Wondering if that could prove easier to integrate (even in the short term) than streaming functionality - just a thought. Re Notes; Im a huge fan of the website/app Simplenote (https://simplenote.com/); a light clean note-taking platform that syncs across multiple devices. Hoping that the Dashboard could provide similar functionality- allowing a user to edit/view on both the LPII and a desktop (great for work notes). Again; just a thought as its a similarly light in feel and aesthetic. Cheers!

Thanks for the thoughtful feedback/suggestions. Will check out simple note; looks cool! We haven't flushed out the nuances of note pad; but integration with desktop app seems nice; assuming we can do so securely. We've been talking to the Mighty player team actually and using their device; and it appears that they got some unique support from Spotify to allow them to take advantage of offline music (not a public API we could use to do that on our own with out their support for instance)."
As future LPII users we are looking for a family project for the summer of 2019!Our idea:     http://light.portners.ch,1 month ago,Love it! Such a beautiful project to do as a family; very inspiring :) Hope all is well Franz!
AMAZING UPDATE! WOW!!! You guys are killing it!,1 month ago,Thanks!!
In response to a previous comment regarding ride-sharing using Lyft and Uber; Uber definitely (at the moment) has a wider international reach (Lyft seems to focus more just on US and Canada as far as I'm aware).,1 month ago,Certainly a trade off we're aware and why we would ultimately want to have both as options; but appreciate you pointing that out because I didn't mention it in my response. Thanks; Rob.
Hello! It is me again! I am excited and can't say it enough. I was happy when I saw the new update. I would also like to add a +1 for possible future Spotify playback; calendar and the microSD. I know everyone is making all these requests; but in time; hopefully we can see some of these things. I have already gotten rid of my iPhone X and am using a dumb phone at the moment until I get my hands on this beauty. Thanks for the update Joe; and look forward to hearing more! Love what you guys do!,1 month ago,Thanks for such kind words and support; Cristian.  Can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you. It's awesome to hear that you already made the jump away from smartphone. Hope you're enjoying it!
Super excited as well for the look of the tools and the teams effort. Let the team know they are doing an amazing job ;),1 month ago,Will pass the word along; thanks :)
No response necessary; just wanted to share I am just beyond stoked with the update.  The tools are minimalist and absolutely exactly what I need to get through the day without a smartphone.  Appreciate  your communication and all the hard work.  Excited for July.  Thank you!!,1 month ago,Cheers!!
Love everything Im seeing. I know its a debated topic but for me its got JUST everything I hoped for & nothing extra,1 month ago,Glad to hear; Dylan; thanks!
Great update. Thank you.,1 month ago,Cheers!
Thanks for the update; this is what I needed to see to contribute; Im excited to make the switch. My iPhone 6plus is fine; but Im tired of all the apps; updates and same platform that now everyone has. Looking forward to see if Spotify will be added. Question though; can I use this overseas in the Philippines? I travel there to see family about once a month.,1 month ago,"Correction; travel once a year. Btw the ads on YT are hilarious yet true?? I show them to whoever is interested in going light

Thanks for jumping on board! Regarding international use; we were unable to fit every single 4G LTE band into one model due to small size as well as interference between antenna frequencies; so there are two models of the Light Phone II. One optimized for North America and one for the rest of the world we're calling Global. The NA model uses bands: B2; B4; B12; B13; B17; B25; B26 and unfortunately a brief google showed that none of those bands overlap with local carriers in Philippines; sorry."
Thanks for the update. Things are looking great!! I want to suggest an extra gimmick for a further release: a battery case with flashlight and MircoSD card slot. This would increase dramatically the use of the lightphone; specially for users that will abuse the Hotspot feature. The MicroSD card would have to add up to the phone's memory so we can store up to more songs and maybe carry some files with us.I hope this gets done some day sooner or later ?Great job and thank you!,1 month ago,It's a cool idea; can't yet promise it will ever come to fruition; but I could see myself potentially using something like that; maybe even if only for longer trips. Appreciate the suggestion!
Thank you for the quick response through email! Your team is doing a fantastic job! I wanted to post a comment though so we can get enough user support for auto fill and spell correct when typing text to be added eventually. Ive been coddled so long I cant spell (or its these fat fingers)!,1 month ago,"Feedback very welcome; would be curious to know how important these features are to others. Auto-fill at a high level seems potentially challenging given such a small screen; auto correct however seems pretty doable to add as an option in the settings. Cheers!

I will be happy either way but I think auto correct is a very useful tool. You guys are awesome! "
Great update! Thanks!,1 month ago,Thanks!!
Hey I backed awhile again when the campaign was first launched. How do I update my address when the device ships?,1 month ago,Hey Jeremiah; Thanks for being an early supporter; it's been quite the journey and we're eager to get you your Light Phone asap. You can shoot us an email at support@thelightphone.com and we will make a note of it; but regardless we will be emailing every backer (likely mid-late June) to confirm their color; model; and up to date shipping address as we've assumed many backers have moved in the course of the project. Cheers!
I really love this phone.  I've been looking for something like it for some time now.  I know you have commented on this some below; but I would like to +1 the addition of a calendar and the notes section.  I want to unplug as much as possible; but I am also forgetful.  Having these on hand would be great while still eliminating the need for social media; email; and browsing the web.P.S. I am a Verizon customer.  Will I still use their plans or a separate payment plan with Light Phone?,1 month ago,"Thanks for feedback regarding calendar and notes; cheers. As for what plan you'd like to use; that is actually totally up to you. We will offer an unlimited plan for $25/mo ( more specific details in next update!); but maybe if you already have a smartphone plan with Verizon it may be cheaper to get a second line from them? Our plan is mostly targeted at user's who plan to exclusively use the Light Phone II as their primary device. Hope that makes sense!

That does make sense. With the functionality it already has while accomplishing it's main goal; I've already backed it. So I am committed to seeing if this will work.Two other questions:1) Does the phone support group messaging?2) is the hotspot an additional charge?Thanks!

Sorry if you get this answer twice; I thought I responded but it's not appearing. It does support group messaging. Hotspot functionality is not a paid upgrade for the phone; all the additional tools are free; but there is likely an additional cost associated with your service plan for your SIM card to have and use hotspot data (similar to hotspot on iPhone). For our Light SIMs hotspot is not included in the base price; and will be an additional cost (__$/gb; TBD). Hope that makes sense!"
"Long time follower first time backer. I've been looking for a ""smart"" phone replacement w/o social media/web that manages to keep the basics like GPS directions (that last update confirming GPS directions pushed me over the edge). Checked out ""feature phones"" but they don't have GPS looked at smartwatches but they have to be tied to a smart phone. Will be following closely and praying it works out!I'm curious what is the estimated battery life on the 2019 models with the 950mAh batteries?",1 month ago,"Hi Aaron; Glad you jumped on board; excited to share a phone with you. It's hard to say with battery estimates confidently at this point honestly. I've been running my phone with some debugging tools in the background and we still have a few optimization tweaks we're wrapping up for this v1.0 goal that should have a pretty big effect on battery life. Hope to have some real life examples to share with everyone sooner than later; thanks for understanding.

I understand completely and thanks for the info!  "
How do I see the update? Havent received an email and cant see it on the website... thanks!,1 month ago,Sorry about that Matthew. You can use this link: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2/x/17193706#/updates/all to see all of our updates. It's a tab called updates that is one of the pages of the campaign (next to FAQ; comments; Story etc.)
Hey guys; great work so far! It's really exciting seeing the projected functionality of the tool sets. It really seems you all are putting in an immense amount of work to see the project through - we appreciate you. This may be a nuance that I'm reading too much into; but I'm curious about the font-weights in the finalized models. I found; particularly in the music / playlist app; that it was difficult to distinguish between artist name and song title; etc.,1 month ago,"I feel like if either the artist name were a Medium or Bold weight it may provide some hierarchy / clarity in the search. Beyond that; as I'm sure you all have been trying things out; I think implementing varying weights throughout the other tool-sets would streamline some of the visuality since the device is solely type-based. 

Hi Parker; That's great feedback; thanks. It's not final for sure; and I'll take that into consideration. I had initially used color to distinguish the two in the mock ups; and it looked great zoomed in big on my laptop screen; but in using the prototypes themselves; color hierarchy is really too subtle and probably not the way to go. Weight or size will likely make more sense. Cheers!"
Latest update looks great - thanks for developing this and striking a good balance between feature-set and simplicity.,1 month ago,Thanks David!! Eager to share the phone with you :)
Big round of ??? for 1.1.1.1 as the default DNS provider. I use it on my personal laptop and it's great.,1 month ago,I will admit I was less familiar with 1.1.1.1; but just judging from the enthusiasm my software team had with the decision and their desire for me to share it in the update was exciting to me. Cheers!
If the phone matches what's described in the latest update; I can honestly; truly say that it will be better than I had ever imagined.Really.,1 month ago,That really brings a smile to us :) Thanks!
My bluetooth headphones have buttons to increase / decrease volume; and to pause and play music.I don't imagine you can answer this for every specific set of headphones; but in general; will the phone respond to these inputs?,1 month ago,That would be our goal; and it should be relatively universal; so I'm really hoping it won't be an issue at all. But I appreciate your understanding that it's hard to say for sure with every specific set of headphones.
Thank you for developing this product. Please keep it as simple as possible. I feel that the number of tools are perfect as they are. Less bells and whistles. More freedom! Can't wait to receive mine!,1 month ago,Hey Dean! We love that users want less features; we want to encourage that as much as possible. Want to make sure it's clear that ANY additional feature is completely optional and would need to be manually added (with user dashboard website). That being said; I think it's a great experience to try going without that 'tool' that you really think you need; because sometimes not having even maps can be really empowering when you realize you were able to figure out/ask your way there. my 2 cents :)
Anything on SMS images? Itd be nice to be view them on the dashboard or something. Also; would a web SMS client be a feature you guys would develop in the future?,1 month ago,"Those two features would likely be one in the same if it comes to fruition; in that it's the same hurdle to solve. It poses a security risk to us to store/sync your messages with the cloud; where as now everything is strictly locked to your phone device; so we'd have to really work that through to be able to offer such a service. Forwarding images to email is easier in that regard. We are doing some explorations of ways to plug your phone into the computer to take advantage of physical qwerty...

...keyboard; and maybe that could also show images. That wouldn't sync your messages to the cloud; just locally let your computer navigate your phone device (we were testing with an app called Vysor that's pretty cool).  Right now and for v1.0; it's safe to assume that images will not be viewable on the device or cloud; and that you would simply see a notification that an image was sent; but not yet be able to forward to email. I don't want to overpromise just yet; thanks for understanding...

...FWIW; I completely see where you are coming from; and those two features syncing messages/images with the user dashboard would be awesome in my opinion. I just want to be realistic in what is possible at this very moment. Thanks for pointing that out though; and it's good to see that others agree that would be really useful."
Thanks for the update! Very excited about the Light Phone! I live in Canada but am planning to spend a year in Uganda from Aug/Sept 2019 to late summer of 2020. I noticed you don't have Uganda listed as one of the countries with support. I would probably want my LP to be the North American version since that is where I will use it on the long term. Would the LP work at all in Uganda? If so; with a local plan or a North American roaming plan? Also; would maps etc work there? Thanks!,1 month ago,You'd have to see what the carriers support in Uganda; because it wasn't listed doesn't necessarily mean it won't work. We didn't check every single country in the world; only where we'd previously seen interest from. The international Light Phone uses bands:B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28; you should be able to confirm with a quick search hopefully. As for maps; it's too early to say for sure confidently. I imagine it'd be a similar answer for if your smartphone maps would work; but to be tested..
What map service does the navigation function use? One of the main reason I have order a light phone is because I want to get away from Googles constant surveillance so if google maps is the default it would be good to be able to change to openstreetmap.The phone looks awesome; can't wait to get my hands on one!,1 month ago,"Great question and because we don't have final decisions around this stuff (and I didn't want the update to become a novel lol) we didn't talk about it yet. Google is certainly an option; but we too are skeptical. Regardless we will have a clear privacy policy for backers with every tool that does require one's location. We definitely don't want to allow Google to track our users and that is a big consideration as we explore the ways to support our directions tool. Cheers!

Thanks for the reply and it is great to hear that you are keeping privacy front and center! "
Hi Joe. Is it still possible to change my perk from 1 phone to the couples one?,1 month ago,Hi Romans; Yep we can help you out if you email us at support@thelightphone.com. Unfortunately there is not an easy way to do so inside Indiegogo; sorry for the inconvenience.
Hello team! Sorry for question; but when Ill get my light phone 2? Please answered me,1 month ago,The majority of backers can expect their phones between mid-July and mid-August. We'll be shipping out in batches to ensure a smooth roll out; and we'll be shipping to our earliest backers first and rolling out so on. If this is not acceptable for your needs; we can offer a refund if you email support@thelightphone.com. Thanks again for the support and understanding!
Hi Joe; Thanks for the new update and hell yeah thats tons of what i had in mind. Especially navigation and ofcz the case! I drop phones alot.. :-) Overall very excited that you broke some of the suspenses with many tools (visually) and now I am confidante that Ill be using LP2 than just as a secondary one. Hope to receive it ASAP and pretty sure Ill be the only user from Dubai! Much love to the LP team.. Cheers!,1 month ago,Glad you enjoyed the update Ali! Cheers :)
Super exited!!!I think this question may have been asked before but I can't find the answer.Would there be an option to develop and sideload apps to the light phone?If yes which programming platform? (React native?)Also would there be a way to upload and share apps via a marketplace (free or paid)?I'm very interested to have banking on my light phone 2 and I found some US banks have an open API so thinking to develop my own app for banking.Thanks,1 month ago,"Hi Shmili; Great questions and love the enthusiasm to develop your own tools. Unfortunately we don't yet have much concrete info; and it's not going to be available in the first wave of tools this summer. We'd likely provide an SDK (it will use React Native). As for marketplace/community; we want to try to support that community sharing; but it would likely have to be separate than the User Dashboard which is the tools Light creates/curates. These are the details we haven't yet flushed out.

Thanks for your reply.Looking forward."
Hey there; can you please verify the status of being able to group text. Looking forward to the phone.Thanks much,1 month ago,"Hi Daniel; Sorry for not mentioning it in this update; but full group texting is expected to be wrapped up in that v1.0 May 25th goal for software. Right now threads are working and we're adding the ability to ""mute"" and ""leave/block"" a thread. Cheers!"
Thnx so much bringing LP2 to life. My old feature phone is acting more quirkie and need this soon ;) pls explain SIM card more. Will I have to choose between one that allows data or not; or is that feature just turned on or off by the provider on the same card? Do you have your plan rates set? Would like to use your plan to support LP future but how would I know if coverage will work in my area? So appreciate the LP2 tribe!!,1 month ago,Hi Cindy! Thanks for the support and can't wait to share the phone with you. Our Light plan for Light Phone II is expected to be $25/mo and will include usage for all calls/texts/simple tools (not hotspot data). It uses AT&T on the backend and we're working on getting a coverage map together. Alternatively you should be able to get any 4G LTE SIM with calls/texts and that should work for the Light Phone II. Sprint is the one carrier we are not super confident in coverage in the US.
hey; im curious for the ride sharing tools. can you use it in indonesia?,1 month ago,Hi William; Sorry to not have a solid answer just yet and to not know more about how ride-sharing works internationally. We didn't mention which platform ride-sharing would support yet because we're talking to both Lyft and Uber. I don't think Lyft has international support outside the US; and I'm not honestly sure to what extent Uber does either; but it'd likely be one of these two options initially. Thanks for understanding!
So beyond excited! Fingers crossed that Spotify is able to work with you guys because honestly that would make this phone a lot easier to adjust to as a 23 year old. Lol. Thank you for all your hard work and I am truly looking forward to July.,1 month ago,Thanks Melissa!
Hi! Just curious about what kind of storage it will have; so I can start planning how many songs I'll be able to fit on it. Thank you!,1 month ago,Hey Mike; The phone has a total capacity of 8gb; and we will likely have to set a limit to how much space the music player can use to keep enough available for the OS and other tools (which are pretty light weight honestly). We haven't flushed out these details exactly yet; but I'd assume at least 2-4gb? Sorry to not have more concrete answers.
What a wonderful email notification to wake up to; thank you all for your dedication to what is going to be an amazing feat!  Loving all the tools you have shared in the update. Particularly the adaptability of the directions tool (walk/ride/car/PT) is fantastic (I have a tendency to get lost frequently) and other tools in the works voice memo/calendar-exciting!! I am very much looking forward to going light in the later part of 2019!!!! Keep up the amazing hard work team! Cheers!,1 month ago,"I forgot to ask - if I am thinking adding in another Light Phone 2 who is best to contact ? Cheers :)

Hey Sarah; thanks for kind words; so glad you enjoyed the update :) Re: adding another Light Phone; or anything else to do with your order; please contact support@thelightphone.com (info@thelightphone.com goes to the same place too). Hope all is well!"
Lastly forgot to mention this? How will tethering work? I always used wifi hotpot on my iphone. this feature is important to me especially if im using a bigger screen android phone for work and use data from light phone. Since the android has more battery life and big screen good for my eyes compared to myIphone which i stop using once light phone arrive,1 month ago,Tethering will work similar to how you'd expect it on your iPhone is our goal. You need a SIM that supports data tethering. One concern we do have is in regard to battery life draw on the Light Phone if tethering; so we'd likely recommend if possible having the Light Phone plugged in.
Also loving the case it perfect almost like the one i used for my iphone SE; the charger is perfect love the grey. Also dont care for ride sharing never used taxi or uber. notepad is important i have alot of documents and notes on my iphone.,1 month ago,
UPDATEEEEE HOW I MISSED YOU. Finally loving the deets and update. gonna take some getting used to with directions as i gotten used to google maps and 3D. Will be harder to follow directions without images especially in the city. but it look good. Love the music cant wait use it also can we add lyric to it? Is there a software or method we can add it? packaging look cool; it be even better if it had backers numbers and name on the front to personalised to people and it make us feel good.,1 month ago,I see what you mean for directions; but realistically I don't think 3D live maps would be a very good experience on the E-ink screen; not to mention how much more engineering resources that might require. There is not a way to add lyrics to the music player; it's pretty simple phone/tools. Cheers!
Hey Joe; Thanks for the update! It brought me a lot of joy today. Stoked on the progress - you guys have really been hustling. All the best to you & the team!,1 month ago,Cheers; Spencer! Thanks for kinds words and support; can't wait to share the phone with you!
Originally; there was a possibility of Google Fi being a part of the carrier list. Is this still possible or will it just be Verizon; AT&T; and T-Mobile now?,1 month ago,Hi Sid; It is not limited to those carriers per say; but rather we just listed the three big carriers that smaller carriers (usually called MVNOs; similar to what Light will be with our SIM offering) buy network space/SIMs from. In theory our phone is compatible with the networks Google Fi use; but we haven't been able to confirm if Google Fi will allow the Light Phone II to use it's SIM. Their site seems to only have support for a few phones; so we don't have a final answer. We'd like it work!
Oh. And I am in the UK. Are you confident it will be compatible with SIMS from all the major UK cell networks? Thanks.,1 month ago,"The bands that the phone will use are the following: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28; you should be able to quickly google what bands your preferred carrier uses and confirm; but from our initial study it did appear to cover the major ones well. FWIW; We tested a Light Phone II in London with a Vodafone SIM and it worked fine.

Thats great. Thanks."
Joe; fantastic update! I'm shocked at how good the tools look; especially directions. I was worried it'd be hard to use but honestly that's perfect. Can we default one mode? I only use public so avoiding the clicks each time would be great. Seriously; amazing update. Literally the only thing that gives me pause still is no incoming B&W image previews. For instance; I'm texting with a friend who just sent me a cute pic of her and her dog. Without even a preview; I'd have to halt the conversation.,1 month ago,".. to get to my email to see the full resolution. That's a little clumsy to me. I think you guys have done an excellent job responding to feedback and adjusting what counts as ""light"" like allowing incoming emoji. Incoming image previews; even though they wouldn't look high res; would at least allow me to respond. Friends send me pics a decent amount and I don't really have control over that so that's why I've brought it up a couple times. Hope you understand! Really looking forward to the phone

Hey man; I do see totally your point and I guess all i can say for now (as we've pretty much tied up with current roadmap of features anyway) is it's something we will continue to consider; especially as we share the phones in mass with all the backers and listen for their feedback. Thanks for understanding!"

I do see what you mean about the b&w preview; and it's still a future consideration. Having lived without it for some time now; it honestly hasn't been as annoying as I was afraid it maybe would; but that's a personal opinion. I've also been enjoying that my close friends just know to send them to my email instead now.
Hi. Looking forward to seeing photos/vids of final version light gray and black phones. Any idea when you will be able to share those?,1 month ago,Two weeks is my best estimation at this moment. Assuming nothing goes terribly wrong; I want to post an update specific to just those photos/vids around the end of May. We are just as eager to share those too; Justin :)
Having two tools for one thing (ie. Ride Sharing) transforms seems not light. It makes me focus on the company and not the functionality or goal. I just reminds me too much of screens and screens of apps the do the same thing but are from different developers. Tools should focused on helping the user do some job and there should be only one per job. Maybe this would be fixed with a hierarchical structure. Just my two cents.,1 month ago,Valid feedback for sure; thanks! I guess I imagined you'd pick your preferred ride-sharing app and not actually download both. Same goes for Spotify and more generic music player; they'd be separate tools too. The technical problem is that lyft/uber are not exactly the same on the backend with how they work with our tool; although the UX flow would remain the same. Perhaps we can in fact solve something like that (both in same tool); but I'm hesitant to say it's even possible yet. Appreciate it!
Hey Joe; I'm a current LightPhone 1 user. Can I port my standalone Light SIM phone number to my LightPhone 2 or would I get a new number?,1 month ago,Hi Cory; Thanks for continued support! It should be no problem to port that number to either a new SIM from us (Light) or a SIM from someone else if you find a more suitable plan for your needs/budget. Hope all is well!
Hello there; very excited to get this phone! I have two questions regarding the actions: 1) When will the podcast app launch (really looking forward to it)2) Will there be a way for tech savvy users to side load custom little actions (use case: my bank offers and api so I could hack something together that shows me my balance; which would be extremely convenient),1 month ago,Hey Tilman;  Cheers! We're looking into an RSS podcast option; which seems like the most universal way to do so (and it was recommended to us by a bunch of backers). Internally if it's as simple as we're hoping it wouldn't be much more work than the generic music player and likely available similar timeline; but I was hesitant to over-promise. Custom side-loaded tools is definitely something we still want to do; but is realistically not going to be ready with first wave of tools unfortunately.
Thanks for the update! I was wondering if the user settings portal will be available to contributors ahead of time? I would like to start tinkering with getting my contacts imported from outlook.com; and possibly even writing a Flow to automate the process.BTW; thanks for including a hotspot as that is my primary internet connection for my laptop when I am at customer sites. Additionally I appreciate the conversations being held with Spotify to try and include it as a tool. Great Stuff!,1 month ago,Great idea; and seems like that makes a lot of sense to release ahead of time. I was planning on sharing the support manual and troubleshooting tips ahead of time as well for people to get an idea of how it works. Not sure the timing for when we might be able to do that; but would be nice to asap. The one thing that might not make it possible to share user dashboard a head of time is I think right now creating the account happens on the phone itself; so I'll need to double check with the team.
Very excited for the phone. I would like to have seen the mobile hotspot be an optional tool instead of accessible through the setting menu. The ability to connect the hotspot to a laptop seems like to much temptation for my internet minimization plans.,1 month ago,"It's great feedback; thank you. Not impossible that we may re-consider that. We had initially planned it as you describe; that it would live in the toolbox menu like other optional tools; but we ultimately came to feel that it made more sense in the settings. Perhaps getting a SIM that doesn't support hotspot is a solution that can work for you. By default our Light SIMs we'll offer don't support hotspot; that will have to be an additional cost for that data (cost TBD). Cheers

Thanks for replying. Joe; maybe a reasonable comprise would be an option to disable the feature on the dashboard? That way is it is convenient and available in the settings;; but people who need some time more completely ""cut off"" can put in a hard stop; that requires a few extra steps to turn back on.

That's a great idea; and not just specific to hotspot; I think it'd be cool to control other phone settings from there too. Especially considering many parents plan to give this phone to their children and are looking for more levels of control. Although I love the idea; want to be realistic that it may be some time before we can explore/release something like this; but we do want to make the user dashboard a useful part of the experience for everyone. Cheers!"
"Hello! The long awaited update has arrived--thank you for all the new info. Very excited :)You mentioned that utilizing hotspot/wifi  ""will require a SIM with appropriate data plan much like on a smartphone"".  Does this mean that if one were using the Light Phone 2 with call forwarding from an existing smartphone/service; the wifi feature will not work?Cheers;Andrew",1 month ago,"Hi Andrew; Thanks for the question and sorry for any confusion here. The Light Phone II will always require an active SIM card to operate as it is a mobile phone. Call forwarding is a universal carrier feature that allows you to forward calls from one phone to another number; but there is no such message forwarding possible. You can swap your SIM from your smartphone to Light Phone to receive messages/calls and if that SIM supports hotspot you can also use it's data to tether another device.

GOT IT! THANKS!!"
Thanks for the update; but I now have a question after seeing the new photos of the light grey phone. Will you be able to see the outline of the screen as shown on the pictures; is there something missing over the top of the screen that would get rid of this?I was just under the impression that you wouldn't be able to see the rectangular outline in the centre after seeing photos prior to the new update.Thanks,1 month ago,"Hi Robert; I'm sorry; but I'm not sure what photos you are referring to exactly. In the latest update titled ""March/April"" we did not show any light grey phone photos. That being said; the active screen area does not cover the entire front face of the phone. When the screen refreshes to load new info (e-ink's nature) the rectangle is obvious because it flashes between white and black. While stationary we've been able to make that difference much less significant; but not 100% invisible...

...We look forward to sharing final photographs of the final phone in about two weeks. If upon seeing the photos/videos you are not satisfied with the result; we will still offer anyone a full refund of course. We're really proud with how the phone has come to life; and the e-ink being unable to cover the entire front face of the screen is a limitation of technology that we've worked around. Thanks for understanding. FYI here's a post we made about screen from last year - https://bit.ly/2Raiixm

Thank you for the quick response. The link helped a lot and has just made me even more excited for the release.

Awesome; glad you checked out the blog post! Cheers :)"
Hey Joe . Thank you so muchI've loved this campaign all the time; wroted a diary; and informed my friends and community about it; I'm so excited to imagine light one and I finally made a purchase. Thank you for supporting the Korean language.   I want to change my SE to Light https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit;w_695/v1557768075/n6c0xzeabd3bjovzzjoj.jpg,1 month ago,Amazing!! Thanks for the support and for helping us get the word about our project into the world. Eager to share the Light Phone II with you :)
Thanks for the update! Really excited to see the tools included at the front end. For ride sharing; do you pick the company (Uber/Lyft) when you make the request? Or is that configurable from the dashboard?,1 month ago,Good question! Thanks for pointing out. It will likely be two separate tools that are available and you can choose which (or both I guess) to add to your phone like you would smartphone. We've been reaching out and talking with both Lyft/Uber and hope to have at least one available in that by end of august timeframe we mentioned. FWIW; Lyft team has been incredibly supportive and helpful so that may turn out to be the first ride-share tool available; but we do plan to have the option regardless.
"I really like that you're giving the ability to choose whether to add tools to the phone; or not! Because as you add directions; ride-sharing; Spotify; podcasting; reminders; calendars; notepads; voice memos; etc. Then the phone becomes a smartphone again and it kind of defeats the point of ""going light."" I hope in the future you will preserve this ability to choose! One frustration with a smartphone like the iPhone is the inability to opt out of software updates and the like.",1 month ago,Hi James; Totally agree. Even just hearing you list all those sounds like a lot for a Light Phone. Options are fundamentally essential to adding these tools in our opinion. It's also worth mentioning that there are some inherent limitations to our device's design that help keep it Light no matter what. The small black and white screen is not great for longer content; images/videos or anything else that keeps us scrolling.  The Light Phone will never have any feeds; advertising; email; news etc..
"hi! without a calendar; I won't be able to ""go light"" as I had hoped; because I depend on my iPhone calendar to know my daily schedule. please add one ASAP! and when you do; will it sync with iCal or google calendar?",1 month ago,Appreciate the feedback and I understand that everyone's needs are going to be a little different and our prioritization of tools may not be perfectly aligned with how you will be using the phone. We really tried to be fair and use the survey to understand what made the most sense for the majority of our users. We haven't dove into Calendar enough yet to know for sure the feature set; but ideally it would be able to connect with both/either iCal/Google calendar. Thanks for understanding!
Beautiful update! Thank you so much for sharing!,1 month ago,Cheers!!
The update was well worth the wait. Exciting times ahead. Can't wait to see some new photos of the light grey model! :),1 month ago,"Thanks Lee!!

Another one... Which do you prefer Joe; Light Grey or Black?

I don't know which one I'll ultimately pick; I'm torn too! I think I'll probably go with the light gray for how kind of unique it feels relative to most smartphones I've ever seen; but having used the black one for past two months in testing; I am loving it too."
Just another quick comment just as my way of adding support for certain tools: - Playlists... really great additional feature to have... if you can get Spotify to buy into them using this device to play 'offline' playlists - it would be amazing. With the ability to update the playlists with 4G if wanted. Mighty Vibe devices do this and I think it's perfect for this. If you got: CallingTextingDirection (google maps)TaxiPlaylist (Spotify)Alarm That does everything needed - distraction,1 month ago,"Hey Jimmy; appreciate the feedback! We've been talking to the Mighty team and using testing their music player ourselves as well as talking to Spotify so it's certainly a possibility.  But so far all of the other tools (assuming taxi is also referring to ride-share) are planned to be in our first wave of optional tools; hopefully available by end of August or earlier. We just posted an update where you can see some of the wireframes; cheers!

Joe Joe; maaate... you are smashing this. This phone; if it works and lasts for two years (at least!) represents an amazing alternative to a Smart Phone. Useful tools; no distractions; no spam;  no constant ads and products selling... just a functioning phone that does what you need it to. If Spotify tool works out - that's literally the perfect phone in my view. Love the style of the OS too - perfect. You guys are on to something brilliant. Look forward to using LP2! Congrats! 

Update is amazing. Amazing.

Also - just re. Spotify... if they don't give you access to API - I would happily change to another streaming service that would work with you... that wouldn't bother me - I just would need a music service linked to streaming to be accessible on LP2 ideally as I don't own music anymore so a music player isn't as useful to me. 

Aw thanks for the kind words Jimmy; so glad you enjoyed the update! I do understand about not owning a lot of one's own music. I don't personally own a lot of digital music files either; so I actually have been starting to rip my vinyls over the past few months (not suggesting that's a solution for everyone). There may be alternatives we can try too; thanks for pointing that out."
Wheres the update??????????????????????????????????????????????? If you cant tell Im excited about the next update :),1 month ago,Haha I do love the enthusiasm!  Happy to say I just posted it :)
Will some form of Spotify be included eventually? Deciding if I need a need a Spotify phone or not.,1 month ago,It is our goal and we're actively in conversation with them; so it's certainly a possibility; but it's going to require cooperation from their team (engineers giving us access to certain APIs; etc) which means it likely won't be available by our initial launch. So far the people we are talking to at Spotify are excited; but it's still a little out of our control as they have their own business interests in deciding to support us or not. Thanks for understanding!
Any chance of getting an update; please?,1 month ago,Sorry for delay on larger update; just posted it now; cheers!
Hey there! What are the final dimensions of the phone? I feel like you mentioned this in a previous update but I can't find where.Thank you for all your hard work! So excited to receive the phone :),1 month ago,No problem :) The final dimensions of the Light Phone II are 95.85mm long x 55.85mm wide x 8.75mm thin.

One of our backers actually helped us get the first fake Light Phone site taken down; will follow his steps to do so again. Really appreciate you pointing this out Ben; thank you!

Hey Joe; no problem I am glad to help however I can! For what it's worth; these multiple fake sites prove that you are on to something. If scammers think your product is good enough to push; then you have a lot of potential with the LP2.:)"
Hey hey just wanted to check if the update is still coming. I know Joe you had mentioned you wanted to definitely get it out this week. Very eager to see what's new!,1 month ago,Sorry about that; just posted the update a few minutes ago; I hope to not be so delayed again. We are already expecting to have another update in about two weeks focused just on final phones! Not really trying to use this an excuse; but for context; in the scheme of the project; the pre-mass production phase we've been wrapping up has been the busiest thus far with lots of overlapping; crucial deadlines that often put the update on the back burner. Sorry Tom!
My son & I agree that he would be addicted to smartphone so we joined yr campaign last Oct; for parents interested check out Waituntil8th.org.  Two ? (1) is there a LOCATE function  (2) do you have any kind of LOSE phone program.My son never having a phone;I have concerns he will lose this beauty. Or maybe I can update/upcharge to 2 phones (couples-assume these are 2 separate units) but will that make delivery of the phones later (not sure if earlier backers get the phone first?) Thanks Joe.,1 month ago,"Hello! Thanks for the support and for being such a thoughtful parent to have such conversations that we think are important to have. The locate phone function ('find my phone') is one of the first optional features that we will make available. It will live on the user dashboard website; so you can login in from a computer/smartphone and ping the location of your son's device. We hope to have that by end of August if not earlier. We don't yet have a lost phone program; but it's a good point

thks for yr reply & the update. Im so glad u will have a LOCATE function. Many parents ""dumb down"" their old iphones (saves on buying extra and Apple also wants to capture this market) but I am really glad to have yr phone for my kid. So many kids just look down and get mesmerized (like adults) by the phone. The Lightphone 2 is a path forward for those of us wary of the downward gazing culture."
"Really excited! I have a ride sharing ? for how it works on practical basis.Will it be focused on getting you ""home"" (recalled marketing emphasizing in passing that point) or will it be more of a on demand go anywhere from anywhere feature just as the smartphone functionality of ride sharing works today? Long story short; is it somewhat neutered feature wise from the smart phone version or fully functional ride sharing features?Thanks! getting my whole family on the lite phone project!!!",1 month ago,Great question; Juan; and excited to share that we'll have some UX mock ups in the next update.  To answer your question; we plan to have most of the functionality; however the design itself will be simplified to typography (instead of seeing little cars on a map). You will be able to choose any pickup/drop off; but some more advanced features like multiple stops is not in our current design; and something like adding a new payment method would need to happen on the user dashboard website.
Hi Joe; Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to know how the light phone 2 is coming up in general; nothing specific. I am sure that will come in the next update/announcements hopefully ?,1 month ago,Overall things are quite well! It's been one of the busiest times of the project as many things need to get decided/designed now so that they are ready for launch. For instance; I needed to get a preliminary manual for FCC testing this week and last night was my deadline for the final packaging art so we can see one last round of samples and have them ready for mass production; so lot's of important deadlines almost every day. Update is pretty much done though! Sorry it's been taking so long
Hi; I would like to know if I can change my shipping adresse ?Regards,1 month ago,Yep; of course. You can email us at support@thelightphone.com and we will make a note of the change; but regardless we will follow up with everyone because it has been so long to double check and confirm their shipping address; color preference etc. prior to shipping. We expect to send those emails in June. Cheers!
Quick question: can we assume you have already chosen your Beta testers?,1 month ago,Yep; although it is a smaller batch than we anticipated initially because the timeline for getting phones produced with the final glass solution would have been too long for testing needs. So the beta phones made are only for testing purposes (rather than being the final product the user can keep) so we decided to make half as many phones (~45). We are also working with various labs as well for more thorough testing (like with Verizon in the US for instance to be certified for their networks).
"My life has changed and my wife and I can no longer ""go light""  can I still get a refund?",1 month ago,Yep; we understand! You'll need to email us at support@thelightphone.com; thanks for understanding!
How can i knwo if phone sent to my home,1 month ago,Prior to shipping anyone's phone we will need to receive a confirmation of your address/model/color preference/and optional accessories. We will be sending that email in June and will also post an update informing everyone to check their inbox for said email. No phones have been shipped yet. Hope that makes sense!
I'm curious if there are patent issues with your product that is going to effect the production of your phone in contrast to Kyocera's version? The Ui doesn't seem to be as streamlined as the Light Phone 2 but the hardware seems way too similar. https://kyoex.com/docomo-kyocera-ky-01l-card-keitai-minimalist-phone-unlocked/,1 month ago,While I totally see the similarities; there is nothing from a patent/legal standpoint standing in our way; but appreciate bringing the point out; thanks.
Hi; just backed this project but I had a couple questions.Are playlists and Maps a confirmed feature?Is there any way for me to retain my primary number? I would like to completely ditch my smartphone.Any chance that release will be sooner than July?,1 month ago,"Sorry wanted to add one more thing.How much does the Light Phone service cost?

Hi Joshua; As for tools we do plan to eventually have those tools and they both fall in our first tier of priority. We expect to have the first batch of tools (prioritized from feedback with surveys) ready by end of August and I'll cover more about those in the upcoming update. So not 100% confirmed to be there the day you open the phone out of the box; but very soon there after. You can use your existing SIM; or port your number (to a Light SIM or other of your choice) and keep your number...

...Not really any chance for sooner release realistically; as amazing as that would be! Our optional service is expected to be $25/month; but users are of course welcome to shop around and find a plan that suits them.

Sorry one more question!Will the Light Phone 2 support different languages while texting?My wife isn't very good at english and all her friends are korean speakers

Unfortunately we can't yet promise keyboards other than English. We'd love to support this in due time; but we're not yet sure how the UX would work or how much engineering resources it would take to achieve. I understand how that can make the phone much less usable for some users; I'm sorry about that; but I want to be realistic about what our small team can pull off. Thanks for understanding!"
Backed after spending months watching and reading updates and comments. This will hopefully replace my smartphone entirely; and I'm very grateful there are other people who have the same view as me regarding the creep of technology.The open and clear communication is very reassuring. If the phone functions; it will be a success. If it does not; it will be a lesson well learned. I recognize the pressure the team must be under. I can only wish you good luck!,1 month ago,"I'll also add that I've switched between smart and dumb phones for over 10 years now. This is special to me because it is beautiful; and recognizes that smart phones offer benefits too valuable to safely discard wholesale and expect to be employable; while also acknowledging the damage they do to the individual who uses them.

All well said; Christopher; thanks a ton for the support and for following along!"
Hi;Back again... with 5G on the cusp of release will this phone be compatible with 5G networks?ALSO.Do I need a smartphone to set up this phone or can I (hopefully) just use the phone as my only option? I noticed with the prior model that you needed a smartphone to set up the phone. This would be a realllllllllll pain as I wanted to go 'permo' light.,1 month ago,This phone does not support 5G; hope there is no confusion there. From a speed perspective; there does not seem to be the need for faster connections for a Light Phone's limited features IMO; and I'm personally still skeptical to how quickly we will see 5G (next iPhones that aren't announced likely still won't have 5G; if looking to them as industry standard). The phone is fully independent of smartphone; and can be your primary device; sorry for not making that more clear!
Just backed - want this as my only phone; done with social media tech distractions. Questions: 1. Are you planning to create brand that produces phones every year? Or is LP2 your only product for some time? Does your business model support maintaining the product long term (beyond 2 years) with software improvements? Is the device powerful enough to support the tools you are looking to release comfortably? 3. Will you be using UBER for Taxi tool and Google for Directions?,1 month ago,"Hey Jimmy; Good questions. Our intention is not try to sell you a new phone every year forever. We do plan to support the LPII long term; part of our business model is also being a service provider (optional for users) and that helps us support the phone long term. It's powerful enough to support the foreseeable tools we imagine on a Light Phone. Ideally we'd have options for taxi (uber; lyft; etc) for users. Directions we are exploring now; and Google is an option.

You are really on to something with this - I know you can't speak about investment opportunities publicly; but if you're able to drop me some general information about your investment model - I'd be interested to take a look."
Just backed after many months of mulling it over... SO excited for the final product!,1 month ago,Thanks for the support; eager to share the phone with you!
digital detox?  If charging and used as an alarm clock at bed; will the phone have the function to turn off all connections if connected to charger?,1 month ago,It wouldn't be an automatic function; but one could use the UP/DOWN buttons to completely silence the phone or in the settings put the phone on airplane mode; which would have no effect on the alarm (the alarm would still work).
3 Million baby! Congrats. Hope all the development is going well.,1 month ago,Cheers!!
3M crossed man.. A proof that there are people out there who wants to go light as much as possible. Lets hear it from you guys soon now. Its been long since we had any update!!,1 month ago,Thanks; Ali! Is there anything in specific you'd like answered in the meantime?
"It becomes a feature  ""permanent display of time and notifications "" when connected to charger?",1 month ago,There is not really a feature like that per say; but that's an interesting idea for a setting perhaps. Right now you can change the sleep settings of the phone and since it uses E-ink; it takes very little energy to keep the phone awake on the lock screen. If you left it plugged in to the charger you'd not even have to worry about the energy used. I've been enjoying leaving my phone on my desk like that a lot. Thanks for the suggestion; Franz; hope all is well!
No more update since 21 March; any more good news?,1 month ago,Will update soon! There has been lots of progress and look forward to sharing all of that good news with everyone soon :)
You're all doing such a great job !!! I'm so so impressed. I look forward to the next update.,1 month ago,Cheers; love the enthusiasm; kind words; and ongoing support! It's been really busy times over here; but equally exciting!! Starting to really see everything come together :)
Thank you for all your hard work! There is nothing out there like this and we are excited to be a part of it. My husband and I have ordered our phones. We would order more for our kids if I knew I could control if/when the WiFi hotspot could be used by them. For my younger ones I would need to know I could turn off the Wi-Fi hotspot feature on their phones. Will this be possible? Thank you!,1 month ago,Great question. With wifi hotspot; to the best of our knowledge; it needs to be enabled by your SIM carrier plan or it will never work. So that if you get a SIM plan for the Light Phone II that does not have tethering option (which is usually an additional cost depending on how much data you want) it should not be an issue. With our optional SIMs; ($25/mo) hotspot is not enabled on the basic unlimited plan and would needed to be added as additional cost similarly. I hope that makes sense!
This is awesome! Can't wait to ditch my attention craving propaganda spreading smartphone.Also Joe is there an update coming soon? Really keen on hearing about the progress :D,1 month ago,Indeed! And love the enthusiasm. I'm going to get out an update this week no matter what; even if it's not the super exciting update with all the final phone photos and videos of the phone that we're dying to share :)  Just FYI; we're expecting to get final phone samples of what will be on the assembly line/ship to everyone  by May 20th and will likely post a second follow up update shortly thereafter too. Cheers!
I can't wait for this; I've finally made the purchase.Can you tell me roughly the weight of the light phone 2.Thanks,1 month ago,I believe it was around ~80 grams. It's potentially shifted within a few grams as we've made minor tweaks a long the way and I just asked the team for our final weight (don't have a scale on me here right now; sorry!).
How will software features/applications get added to the phone post-launch?,1 month ago,Updates are able to happen wirelessly; which is awesome. To add optional tools a user would need to use the website which we are calling 'user dashboard'; but normal system updates will happen wirelessly. Hope that makes sense!
Howdy Joe.A small request for the next update: I'm really pleased with everything I've seen in the phone so far; but I'm still very curious about how the phone/screen will handle scrolling and typing due to the limitations of e-paper. Could you show the typing of a text message; and the scrolling through the contacts list?Thanks!,1 month ago,Totally understand; and this has certainly been an area we have been spending much of our engineering effort behind the scenes as it is crucial to the experience. The EPD driver (which is how the screen communicates with our OS) is still being optimized/bug-fixed; it's actually what our team is working on with Eink/our mfg. partner in Taiwan right now. We'll have a v1.0 software by no later than May 25th that will reflect the final experience and we'll likely wait to show that until then.
Hey Joe;Hoping you are wellI even didnt ask myself about regions/countries compatibility!To follow Richard OSullivan; can you confirm Light Phone 2 will work in France ?Thanks and keep on rocking !,1 month ago,Hi Simon; It is certainly compatible in France; sorry for any confusion there. Just to be clear there are two models of the phone and prior to shipping we will be sending a final confirmation email (to check latest address/model/color preference) that will have much more details about compatibility too. The Global model uses bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28; which appears to have great coverage through out all of Europe which was our goal. Hope that makes sense!
Hi Joe; in a reply below you mentioned that the LP2 supports various 4G bands 4G LTE FDD + VoLTE on bands: B2; B4; B12; B13; B17; B25; B26.  In Ireland; the main providers use band 20 (800 MHZ)and band 3 (1800 MHZ).  Does this mean that the LP wont work in the UK and Ireland; or is there a different version for that region? Thanks!,1 month ago,Hi Richard; Sorry for any confusion there. There are two models of the device; one for North American region and another for Global use outside North America. The bands you mention are for the North American model. The Global model uses bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28 ; which cover the 3 and 20 you mention.  This will be clearly explained with a way to check compatibility with largest carriers in your region in our final confirmation (address/model/color preference) email prior to shipping.
For those worried about the build material; if you never played with those $50 Lumias when Windows Phone was around; you missed out. They were a delight to handle and hold. Plastic isn't a bad thing.,1 month ago,Hey Jeffrey; don't know how I missed this comment; sorry to not say anything sooner! I do personally still wish it would have been possible for aluminum of course; but I have been impressed with the Light Phone II materials. Thanks for pointing that out; I'm not familiar with those phones.
waiting excitedly! not sure if this has been asked but will there be a do not disturb function that would only allow calls and texts from a few numbers when on? this would be huge for me. Thanks,2 months ago,"We do plan to have notification settings as well as some filter options. A quick question regarding the feature you are asking about: When we think Do Not Disturb; to us that means that you would not get the notification in the sense that it wouldn't buzz/alert you; but that it would still show in your phone feed; and from your question I can't tell if you mean you would not want those calls or texts to come through to the device at all (& would never appear in your phone history)? Thanks!

Thanks for the quick response! I would like it to be like you said where it doesn't alert you; for everyone else; but for a few contacts(i.e wife) it would still buzz/alert

Thanks for the follow up; that makes sense!"
I just want to say thank you to all the people that are contributing their time and expertise in bringing this product to light (sorry; had to). I know there have got to be quite a few people working long hours behind the scenes. Thank you all! Where are you guys in the timeline that was shared in January? Have you completed PVT2? Have beta phones been distributed? Do you have a target date for starting mass production? When do you hope to post the next update?,2 months ago,Thanks Bradley; it's all hands on deck over here for sure; especially with lots of our team in Taiwan with timezone differences. We're tightening up last firmware tweaks as we go through various certifications (like PTCRB) and begin to prepare for mass production. We are still on track with the  timeline we shared in terms of final delivery; details have shifted with PVT2 and Beta (will expand in next update; early next week eta); but overall mass production is still on track as expected.
What opportunities do you have for investing in this?,2 months ago,Hi Katelyn; Thanks for your interest. FYI; since Light is a private company; we (legally) can only discuss with accredited investors (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp). If you are an accredited investor and interested in learning more; please shoot us an email to support@thelightphone.com. We cannot (legally) discuss any opportunities publicly either (which is why I replied to previous backer initially with an email). Hope that makes sense!
finally backed after reading the comments/updates for a long while. I am very excited to leave my iphone behind; however to make the switch for good I really hope podcasts & playlists and hopefully a direction tool will definitely become optional tools.Stoked for the final product!,2 months ago,Cheers; Spencer; thanks for jumping on board; can't wait to share a Light Phone II with you!
Wow. I am saddened by all of these optional add-ons. The smartphone is full of optional add-ons encompassed on the App Store. If you want pictures wait for your email. Or print it out and frame it or hang it where you work. Bring a hard copy calendar when you need it or make a small note and text it to yourself. Learn some rounding techniques for a calculator. Music...the world is full of music; let this phone take you away from the artificial music and immerse yourself in the music of earth,2 months ago,"I dont mean this to be mean to anyone wanting these as options. As honestly they all sound amazing to me. But I keep coming back to...this yearning for extra features (optional count too) is exactly why I want to get away from the smartphone. This phone; from what I read and have learned to embrace is supposed to remove all of those optional features. Call a cab. Call a friend. Text a family member. Call a loved one while driving to let them know you are safe. Put down the phone for extras

Again love love love the product and its vision. I just hope these optional features are not included. As my and so many others are attracted to those kinds of things and are going to this phone for a release from these addictions or yearnings. Keep up the great work! Cant wait for the next update. And I am quite excited to receive one when they are ready!

Hi Eric; Seriously appreciate the feedback and can definitely see where you are coming from. Our original Light Phone ONLY made calls and so even adding texting took us a while to come to terms with honestly. What we learned though was that because our last phone was 'so light'; and users loved 'going light' so much; that they wished they could replace their smartphone if only it had texting and maybe _(insert tool you think you can't live without)___. It's  a really interesting conversation...

...we tried to set hard lines for what the phone would never do (and could never do well with the small; black and white e-ink screen). We said no feeds; no images; no advertisements; no news; no email; which would all be clearly the opposite of the Light Phone ethos. There are other things like having a playlist that are more debatable; one can argue that it helps them focus in a crowded airport during a layover; or one could argue its just as much of a distraction as social media...

...I dont think adding a calculator; or directions; or even a way to hail a ride-share home are going to be distractions that take one out of the moment to check and check and check again. We of course; will never force these features on any user; but we are trying to be empathetic that for some users this will make it possible for them to ditch their smartphone for longer stretches of time or for good; which is the ultimate goal (while obviously staying true to the ethos)...

... We've been enjoying the conversation about what everyone thinks constitutes a Light Phone and we will do our best to find a balance of helping to make the phone usable while not drifting away from what makes the Light Phone a Light Phone. We also want to challenge everyone to go without those features we think we so desperately will need; because sometimes not having them can be incredibly empowering. Thanks for being a part of the conversation :) Hope all is well!"
Also is LightPhone open to any investors; besides people just the crowdfunding with people paying for perks/phones?,2 months ago,Emailed you; thanks for you consideration.
I am an adolescent therapist and know many parents who would like to have a better phone alternative than a smartphone. But; one of their main hangups would be that many (too many) like monitoring their child's whereabouts. Will that be an option with this phone? Also; parents like being able to limit how much time their child/teen spends on apps on their phones. Is there any option for parent controls with this phone; such that parents can limit how much texting their child does?,2 months ago,"Hi Kreg; We've had a lot of interests from parents for sure. A parent can manage the child's phone from their own account (a website we call user dashboard). We are planning a ""find my phone"" feature that a parent could use on the website to see the location of their child's device. There are not yet ways to limit how much texting a child does; but it's something we can consider if many parents request that. By you controlling the account; a child would not be able to add any 'tools' FYI.

Joe; thanks for the reply. I'm really excited about this phone as I think it will be a great option for parents who a way to connect with their young teen without the baggage of a smartphone. The ""find my phone"" feature will be a plus for many teen parents. As far as considering parent controls for texting; it sounds like you are saying that potentially could be a software update down the road if enough parents showed interest?

Yep; those would become available as software updates if pursued. There are a few other parent-oriented features we've thought of in talking with some of our backers that plan to give the phone to their kids as well.

Thanks. Can I ask what other parent-control features you've talked about? One I think that would great for some parents would be if there is a parent-control option such that children can't delete texts that they send or receive. Parents of emotionally troubled teens would love that feature. And I think parents of younger teens/tweens would also be interested in guiding/coaching their children as they enter the world of digital communication. And then they could turn option off as child matures.

In general it may be that we end up creating an optional parental control mode for the user dashboard with some of this extended functionality in due time. The ability for parents to view history was one potential feature we discussed with parents; but also limiting who the phone can call/text inbound/outbound as well as the mentioned location tracking. Other ideas parents brought up included insurance plan (for replacements) and wanting cases (we will have at least one of those by launch).

That's not to say exactly that this a roadmap; because some of those features like viewing one's history come with lots of privacy trade offs/security risks perhaps that we would really need to work through if ever possible; it was more of a high level understanding of what parents were most concerned about. Lack of images/camera/internet were the biggest points we gathered. Location ping and wanting Lyft/Uber were also quite high. The viewing history I just mentioned was much lower interest."
Hello everyone! I was just wondering; even if it's probably to late; if there were a possibility to consider adding a NFC tag. It would be a great functionality to replace also credit cards; to make you even less worried during the day!Love the project and his purpose. Really hope that more people will spend less time on their smartphone. Keep it up!,2 months ago,Hey Alexander; Appreciate the suggestion but it is too late for us to consider any hardware changes at this point without pushing the timeline significantly. Thanks for understanding!
Would you be able to share any new experiments with sound? That was the highlight of the last update for me. Cheers!,2 months ago,"Awesome; so glad you like that part of the last update. It's definitely been one of the more fun aspects of the phone design to think about (""what is a ringtone?"" ha). I'm not sure we will have much in this next update; but if not the following update for sure. Thanks again for following along and the suggestion!"
Hey all! I noticed some asking about purchasing spare parts and I understand  how the proprietary nature of this device might not lend itself to DIY repair. With a typical smartphone; I'd be less concerned with coverage since shiny new tools often strong-arm us into annual upgrades. This phone; by design; serves as a break from this cycle and likely isn't a part of an annual; iterative series. Will there be; in parody; a repair service that serves the seemingly 'final' utility of this device?,2 months ago,We will be able to repair the devices; but as a small scale operation (relative to all other phone manufacturers) we will be doing repairs initially in batches with our manufacturing partner. But you're spot on about us not wanting users to replace the phone for a new one every year. We're not opposed to trying to make available spare parts eventually; but the phone design is not very easy to repair by hand unfortunately so I'm not sure if it will end up making sense to or not.
disappointed the phone is going to be plastic :/,2 months ago,"Also disappointed by micro-usb in 2019 :(

I understand Keith; sorry. Those two factors have disappointed me as well as a Light Phone II user too. Unfortunately the aluminum design proved too hard for us to solve with the antennas and our budget/timing. USB-C would have caused the phone to grow a pretty decent amount which we also felt didn't justify it in a trade off. If you are no longer interested in the Light Phone II in light of this; email us (support@thelightphone.com) for a refund. Again; sorry and thanks for understanding."
Scrolling through the comments seems to mostly be a list of features backers would like to see added. That's cool. However; I just wanted to speak up on behalf of those that are looking forward the very smallest set of essential tools; and backed the project for that reason. Excited for the roll out.,2 months ago,"Thanks for chiming in; Douglas! Couldn't agree more; and  we'd even like to challenge everyone to try going without those features that we ""feel we can't live without"" because (and we saw this with our first Light Phone feedback) it is actually empowering to get by without those features sometimes. There are seemingly a million excuses for why one might chose a smartphone over a Light Phone for any given situation (""what if...?""); and overcoming those excuses can be really powerful IMO. Cheers!

hmmm... agree to disagree? That sounds like the Apple approach: put many options into the product to appeal to the largest possible customer base; relying (reasonably) on the users' discretion on whether to use twitter or not. My understanding (maybe false) that this project was about a device which removed that tendency; and delivered a product which would be used ""as little as possible"". Having a google calendar or audio books is at odds with my perception of your mission.

I see your point for sure; thanks. I think we've set some hard lines in place (no advertising ever; no feeds; no images; no news; no email; eink screen) that help keep things 'light'. Twitter to me is a different beast than someone wanting a 'light calendar/reminders' of their next few events; although I will admit I don't personally want a calendar or audiobooks on my Light Phone. I do want to make the phone as usable for users as possible so that they can leave their smartphone for good."
I'm not sure if this is worth commenting or not; but I think my way of using the phone will be different than I answered in the survey a while back. I suspect I'll use it every few weeks to get a break from my regular phone; as I'm starting to realize sometimes I need to have a digital detox; but other times I like being connected. Anyway; I guess one question I'll ask is; other than texts being confined to each phone; is there any downside to switching sim cards between phones now and then?,2 months ago,Hey Crystle; Thanks for sharing; I think that sounds like a great way to use the phone. No real downside other than taking the time to swap the SIM. I think it makes a lot of sense that users would find different balances that work for themselves and I'm excited to learn about the different ways our users go light and what works well/not so well. It could be cool to profile different users as examples/tips for ways other people are integrating the phone into their lives. Cheers!
Hey! I've just purchased my Light Phone 2 and wanted to understand the music player on the device? - I have over the past few years weaned myself completely off social media; however; I still have my Spotify account. My preference would be to retain Spotify as I personally believe manually downloading music would be a real pain and I feel like I have come along way from my piratebay days. What is the current consensus?,2 months ago,Hey! Thanks for the support :) We'd like to offer a few types of tools for music/audio.  Initially we will likely build one in which you can upload your own songs as it's the most universal but even more so that in order to partner with Spotify we need some engineering resources and cooperation from their team. We've already opened up that line of communication and hope that we can also offer a 'light' Spotify tool (likely limited to one/few playlists; not searching etc.). Hope that makes sense!
Hey team... Just have a question regarding support; will there be parts available (screens etc) I'm in New Zealand.  Cheers and super excited about how the developments are progressing.,2 months ago,Hi Rob; Great question; but not sure I have a great answer. Unfortunately due to the customized nature of the Light Phone II; I don't think that it will be easily user-repairable or even more so that parts won't be readily available. It's something we'd like to work on improving; but want to be realistic about where we are currently.
"Hello there;Many comments are calling for more features (and app). Don't forget; those who are satisfied with the initial project and want to keep things simple; ""light"". Cheers.",2 months ago,"Of course; we could never forget; and still want to actively encourage everyone to really second guess those features that ""we think we can't live without"". I just want to point out in case it wasn't clear; that all additional functionality is optional and you can completely ignore all of it and keep your phone super light :) ... and we think that's awesome! Cheers"
It's the end of April and shipping was due this month; I think the lease we all deserve is an update on why we haven't received product yet.,2 months ago,Hi Joe; Have you been able to see our regular updates that we send. We announced in January a shift to the timeline; I'm sorry if you were not receiving these; we never meant to keep anyone feeling in the dark! We will begin shipping in July; and you can read about the details in the updates tab. If that no longer works we can of course offer a refund if you email us at support@thelightphone.com. Sorry for any confusion and thanks again for the support!
Will this have GPS? I just backed it. But can only use if it has navigation.,2 months ago,The phone has a GPS for sure (which is hardware). We are currently working on an optional navigation tool (software) that we hope to have available by launch or shortly there after; but it is not 100% confirmed for our initial launch. Hope that makes sense!
@ Patrick Milot  Same.,2 months ago,"Love the enthusiasm; hope to have the update soon! As I just replied to Patrick - no real good excuse other than that we've been really busy keeping everything moving ahead and nothing significant has changed to timeline; still pushing for July delivery. Is there a specific question that you have in the meantime?

No Joe; I jut really look forward to the updates; I love seeing the photos of the phone; the staff working; the UX/UI; ringtones; ... basically this is the best Kickstarter (LP1) & Indiegogo (LP2) projects that I have ever backed  due to your teams open communication; delivery; thought behind product; packaging etc.  I just enjoy reading the updates.  "
update???,2 months ago,Hey Patrick; Sorry for the delay; no real good excuse other than that we've been really busy keeping everything moving ahead and nothing significant has changed to timeline; still pushing for July delivery. Is there a specific question that you have in the meantime?
Hi Joe; Waiting desperately for an update on the campaign. A quick question though... Are you guys also planning to have To Do videos or like short tour videos of interface and different functions? I saw the video in the last update about the call function and sort of came to a thought it might be a good idea! Cheers!!!,2 months ago,Hi Ali; Good point; we are definitely wanting to have very thorough videos/step-by-step tutorials of the phone and ideally we plan to send those out before everyone even gets the phone so that you can get more comfortable with the device. The only reason we haven't shared those videos yet is because there is still a lot of subtle changes being implemented as we go through testing.
Hi. Shipping was planned for April. Any news on when theyll ship to Europe? Excited.,2 months ago,"Hi Paul! Hope that all has been well. April was our initial shipping goal; but unfortunately we announced in our update in January that we would be behind our timeline (you can see the updates in the tab on the campaign). Our current timeline has mass production kicking off in late June and through July. We expect backers will receive their phones in July/August. If this is no longer acceptable we can certainly offer a refund if you email us (support@thelightphone.com). Thanks for understanding!

Ok thanks. Didnt get the update - just keen. 

Totally understand; especially if you didn't see the update. We're very eager to share the phone with everyone. Thanks again for helping us bring this project to life. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
Hi Guys; Will there be a copy/paste/forward functionality in the text messaging app? This is a small thing that makes a big difference.Thanks!,2 months ago,There is not currently a copy/paste/forward; but it's a great idea and I can certainly see it being useful in a bunch of little situations for sure. It's in our notes to explore for sure; but thanks for pointing that out!
Will the LP2 work on GSM and CDMA networks like AT&T; Verison; Sprint; T-Mobile; etc.?,2 months ago,I don't want to accidentally misspeak (because I believe CDMA and GSM were more relevant to 2G/3G?); but the phone supports 4G LTE FDD + VoLTE on bands: B2; B4; B12; B13; B17; B25; B26 which will have coverage on all of those carriers except Sprint; which it may get some coverage but we are hesitant to recommend using this phone on Sprint.  I hope that makes sense; but let me know if I can further clarify anything else! (I've been testing my prototype on TMobile fyi).
+ 1 calendar +1 contact / calendar : cardDAV - calDAV compatible for remote contact & agenda sync+1 dev open source community to add functionnality later onkeep up the good work ;)awesome projectI can't wait to receive the final product !,2 months ago,Appreciate the feedback and support a lot! Thanks; Guillaume. Can't wait to share the final product with you either :)
"Hey Joe & Team;Just wanted to add my +1 for adding photo functionality to the Light Phone. I currently use a ""Logic B5G; "" which has a teeny tiny screen. It still gets the job done; since a lot of the images being sent (of a relative; friend; or pet) convey a connection or feeling. The resolution and size do not matter as much as the joy of getting a shared memory via MMS in image format from someone who cares about you. The ""Big Picture"" doesn't need to be so big!Thank you for listening!",2 months ago,"Hey Ben; hope all is well. Appreciate the +1; we are definitely taking note. Although I'm still hesitant to promise it just yet; we're certainly listening to everyone and opening to the idea. FWIW; I've been using the prototype phone and have had a few instances that friends will send me an image; and I've simply asked them to email it. Now that it's been a few weeks; a few of those friends will just know to email me images instead of texting and it's been working out kind of nicely in that way.

Hey Joe;Thanks for the reply! I totally get that - I get photos of my baby to email most of the time; but it is still really nice to get a picture via text sometimes! Wishing you ""Uber"" success in all that you do;Ben Yehoshua"
I will add my support for a simple calculator (addition; subtraction; multiplication; and division). I'd also like the alarm clock to support four or five alarms (I currently have four alarms: wake up M-F; wake-up Sa-Su; medicine reminder in the am; medicine reminder in the pm). Beyond that; talking; threaded and group texting; and contacts (with the option to send automatically to voicemail calls from numbers not in contacts) is all I really want.I'm now using the Kindle Fire 7 for audio.,2 months ago,Simple calculator is exactly how we were imaging it to. We've been exploring UX for adding additional alarms; but right now the OS only supports one alarm at a time. Will keep everyone posted regarding that. I also like your filtering idea too; we've been trying to think of the simplest way to have filtering options for our users. Thanks as always for sharing; Gregory!
Hi There; I know the phone is supposed to have a minimal amount of features; but is there any possibility of considering being able to listen to audio books? I know others have suggested features such as podcasts which kind of fall under the same category so though i'd ask. Thanks.,2 months ago,"Hi Mitchell; We plan to have initially a way for users to upload their own audio files (music; podcasts; audio books etc); so that will be possible. What may take much longer is if we are to make a specific tool that works with an audiobooks platform; we'd need the cooperation of their engineers. We're not opposed to trying; but no such conversations are on the table at the moment. Hope that makes sense!

That's good to hear; thanks for the reply!"
I just wanted to say how hyped I am to go Light later this year. The work everyone in the team is doing is amazing. I love the vision; design; everything. You've got this :),2 months ago,Wow thanks so much for the sweet note; Lee. I am humbled and eager to share the Light Phone with you this summer. Hope all is well!!
What's the team's POV on adding Podcast and music features on to the phone? While I enjoy both in moderation; I personally find them to be just as distracting as other types of media which the phone is designed to omit. They (especially Podcasts) prevent the mind from ruminating on its own. If one or both of these features do make it into the phone; can there be a way to lock them out? Thanks for the frequent updates. I am looking forward to getting the phone later this year.,2 months ago,"Hi Christopher; Firstly I think it will make sense to explain that any of the 'additional tools' we plan to offer are always completely optional; so no one is ever forced to have unwanted tools on their phone :) We want to offer a way for people to have those features if they want them and likely there would be a few options for music (adding one's own songs to maybe collaborating with a streaming platform). Regardless it would be a 'light' experience...

...I will admit; you are on to something about them being distracting. I was so used to always listening to music everywhere I went and having been using a Light Phone prototype with no music I'm enjoying the lack of music more than I thought I might. Maybe it's just because spring is coming; but hearing the birds so loud everywhere and just being able to keep my train of thoughts going has been nice. I would love to have a playlist of some songs still; but it's been a pleasant surprise to me.

Great to hear. Thanks for the thoughtful reply."
I need to request a refund. My phone broke and I had to get another one. As much as I wanted to try this; I can't afford both phones.,2 months ago,Hi Jenna; Sorry to hear about your phone; if you haven't already; please email us at support@thelightphone.com and we can help you out with the refund. Thanks again for spending time with our project!
I agree with Z Jenkins below about having a calculator; It would be really helpful and simple! Also being able to receive photos would be great as well; even if you can't send any.  Thanks a lot Joe!  Super excited.,2 months ago,"Also; I am curious as to why the screen display does not go all the way to the bottom of the phone?  Since the phone is small I would think that the screen would be as big as possible to maximize use.  I am not an expert on this and there is probably a simple reason but I thought i'd ask. Thanks!

Hi Andrew; Thanks for the support! Calculator is in the plans; so hope to have that available sooner than later. Receiving photos is something we are certainly considering so thanks for that feedback too. The screen display itself is a module that is bigger than the active display that you see through the front glass; so those other pieces (cable ribbons and connectors) are taking up most of the space around the display currently. It came down to what we could fit ultimately."
It pains me to say that I am now in a point in my life where I would not be able to work around the limitations of Light Phone II. The work that I do requires me to be able to easily take/send photos and videos from my phone. So; as much as I love this phone and as much as I want to support it; I need to request a refund.,2 months ago,Understandable; Kenneth; thanks again for the support and sharing your feedback with us along the way. If you haven't already; please email support@thelightphone.com and we can get you your refund. Cheers
One of the biggest features that I would appreciate is a Calculator! I'm an engineer and always pulling my phone out to make basic calculations.(also displaying the black/white sms image would really be helpful. There's a lot of us who plan on using the phone as a primary and I get a lot of pictures from my friends & family) ..in my opinion it adds context. The fact that the image is black/white will not distract from the minimalist design (to me anyways).,2 months ago,"..also might want to consider making part of the GUI open source so people have the option to code their own features (like the calculator) if it's not already available. (just a thought; I love the concept regardless)

Thanks for the thoughtful feedback. Calculator is something we plan to offer; it's certainly a useful tool for many situations. I see your point about b&w images; and we are certainly taking it into consideration. We do plan to eventually have an SDK for users to create their own tools; so good news there too. Cheers!"
I am looking forward to seeing the product when it ships. I am someone who will use this phone full time; which is why I am hopeful that it will eventually have a synch-able calendar.  Those who will continue to have a second phone naturally don't care about it; but; for those like me; who are one phone users; calendar functionality will greatly increase the utility of (and; I suspect; the demand for) the phone.,2 months ago,Thanks a ton for the support and feedback; that definitely makes sense Steven. I hope that we are able to get a calendar tool sooner than later for users like you!
Hi JoeCan you share March19 update on the product development?,2 months ago,Hoping to have a new update asap; cheers!
Hi Joe;will the phone have an always on display that shows the time?,2 months ago,"The lock screen; which displays the time large and center on the phone; is how I've sometimes been leaving my phone on my desk because of EInk display you can do so without killing battery. There are different sleep settings (how long before the screen will go back to sleeping which is a blank screen); but it's been really nice to be able to leave the phone ""on"" with the time. If I get a text; I'll see the * next to the time (i.e 2:22*). Hope that makes sense!"
Hi; Joe/Team. Is Audio MMS supported? I feel like it would fit in the contact stream; nicely.,2 months ago,Good point; Jeffrey. It's not in our current v.1 planning; but we are looking into the voice memo tool/audio control in general so that we can explore it in a future update. I agree that it seems appropriate; especially given the small screen size.
Hi Im a backer in Tanzania at the moment - will the phone work here? Theres the posssibility of Vodacom; Airtel or Tigo networks. Looking forward to it; thanks!,2 months ago,"Hi Matthew;  The international model uses the following 4G LTE bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28; you should be able to check which bands your carriers use and confirm if the phone will work for your needs or not. Thanks and sorry to not be more helpful there.

No problem; this is such an d citing project to be a part of; I love the idea of the simplicity that this will bring"
Hey joe; i was wondering for optional feature such as simple games and how they work on ink screen in the old days of flip phone games were in black and white and popular one like snake and bouncing ball etc from nokia era were fun but simple. would a emulator work on it like original gameboy in black and white.,2 months ago,Things that require animation would not work as well on the E-ink screen. We haven't really explored the idea of simple games; and it's something I'd be curious to get a better sense of what everyone else thinks. If we were to explore games; things like mine-sweeper would translate better on the screen than pong/snake. Hope that makes sense!
Hello -- any thoughts on using the phone as an e-reader? Thanks!,2 months ago,We are afraid that the screen size would likely be too small to be an effective e-reader. The phone is close to the shape of a credit card; which is a lot smaller than we are used to for long readings. Hope that makes sense!
Joe; April is coming to an end; when will the phone be shipped? I have been waiting for a year...plz replythx,2 months ago,Hey! I'm sorry if you have not been receiving our regular updates (they come via email from indiegogo and can also be viewed in the updates tab of the campaign - https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2/x/17193706#/updates/all ). I believe it was the January update that we announced a change in our timeline; in which users can now expect to receive their Light Phones this July. If this is too long to wait we understand and can offer a full refund (email support@thelightphone.com).
I am super excited for this... And I hope before the end of July I have it in my hands. However; I also hope you are enjoying what you are doing enough to immediately start on Light Phone 3 once this releases and you get feedback.,2 months ago,I'm also super excited for everyone to have it in their hands! I'm certainly enjoying the ride; and often feel like one of the luckiest people alive to be working on something I'm so passionate about. Although there is certainly a lot of pressure and things don't always go according to our plans which takes its toll too. We just want this to be the absolute best it can be and to not disappoint any of our backers whom we genuinely appreciate so much.
Agree with the calendar or other function that can set time/date alerts. For incoming pics; how will the phone handle this? On my MP02; it only says cannot download and does not give me an option to forward to email or another phone. Thanks and look forward to the next update.,2 months ago,Hi Dominic; Appreciate the feedback. Currently the experience is similar in that there will be an icon to indicate that an image was sent. We are curious to explore forwarding functionality as well; but have not yet built it out. There is also the possibility to display the image; albeit black and white and small; on the device; but that one we are not sure we are comfortable with yet (a lot of users bought our phone because it has NO images; so we want to sensitive to that fact).
Hello; Joe!  I've been a backer for almost a year now and the phone is looking good!  I'm a big fan of the fact that you've decided to include WiFi hotspot capability.  For me; this is something that will truly allow this phone to replace my current smart phone.,2 months ago,Cheers; thanks!
Would like calendar - to know when/where my kids dance practice is - or if the meeting was at 8:00 or 8:30am.,2 months ago,Appreciate the feedback Julie; hope to have that functionality for you in due time on the Light Phone II.
Hello Joe.  I remember at some moment you were considering a gray version which would be the one that matches the best the body and the screen of the LPII. Are you still thinking in this third color? Thanks!,2 months ago,Hi Jose; I should be more clear with colors in our next update; thanks for pointing this out and sorry for not making this more clear to everyone. We are planning to do only two colors the lightest and darkest shade of e-ink to match the screen; so yes we will be doing a light gray version and a black (dark charcoal really; not pure black). Hope this makes sense!
Thanks for pointing this out; Byron! I was also wondering why I never received any updates.,2 months ago,Glad it will work going forward!
I read below that we should be receiving email updates? I've literally never received a single one (went back through the Spam folder too; nothing there).... Went back to my Profile and it needed verification to send emails for some reason. So; just an FYI for anyone else who hasn't received any updates; etc. via email.,2 months ago,Very helpful; cheers Byron!
Hey Joe;So this the Light Phone 2 going to end up having a music player? If so I'm guessing it will be available after launch?,2 months ago,We are starting to kick off tools with our software team and hoping to have a few for launch. Music player is still potentially possible for launch (one's own songs likely rather than a partnership with a streaming service); but it may be shortly after launch. We're ramping up our resources to try to get the tools as quickly as possible! Thanks for understanding.
Based on the pictures I have seen on the white model; the e-ink display will be black for the font-color and whatnot. Is that still correct? I know in the older original Light phone; the white model had the white numbers; which I don't like.  I love what you guys are doing; and I can't wait until July to get it in my hands! Im kind of torn between the colors even though I got the white one.,2 months ago,Hi Christian; That is correct; the font color will not be white on white; that was only possible due to the unique lighting we used in the original Light Phone; which was very limiting in that it was fixed interface. It suffered greatly with legibility in bright light; which this new E-ink screen excels at compared to smartphone screens. You will have a final opportunity (an email confirmation from us) prior to shipping and upon seeing lots of photos to decide the color FYI. Cheers!
Do you have any pictures of the white prototype? Will it look anything like the renderings provided on the campaign page or will the glass be very distinguishable from the rest of the phone?,2 months ago,"Hi Patrick; The ""white"" phone is actually going to be ""light gray"" so that it matches the background of the E-ink display. We've spent many months trying to perfect the front glass display to match the color/reflection of the screen and the phone and are excited with where we've come. When using the phone you can still tell where the e-ink display is; especially as it refreshes between screens. Hope that makes sense! We will be sharing photos as we finalize the phones in our updates; cheers"
"@Christine Evans; who commented below; thank you for the reminder about making things work in alternative (dare I say ""old school""?) ways. I must agree. Though I still like being reminded which day of the week/month it is; my appointments and schedule have rarely been digital. I love having separate; single-purpose devices. I think so many of us want to have fewer items; but there's something reassuring about having an item that just does one thing; and does it well.",2 months ago,Plus; those things are often tested by time; so you know they work. Also; if something breaks; it's just the one thing. So if my calendar gets wet; I need not worry about my music player's files being corrupted (unless; I guess; if that got wet too; lol)
"My plan is to keep my current smartphone at work for things like authenticator apps; and whatever else I need that isn't ""light"".This might not work for everyone; but its a solution for some people who want to go light as often as possible.",2 months ago,That's how I imagine a lot of users will use their two phones actually. I have an old iPhone I keep at the office so I can check into Light Phone social media accounts and answer people's questions; but I love not having to bring social media with me everywhere I go. Thanks for sharing!
"Hi Joe; just wanted to let you know I previously refunded by just backed again. I really believe in what you guys are doing and I'm super happy to see stuff like emoji support (at least for incoming messages; I'd love it for outgoing as well as it still feels ""light"" to me). Has there been an update on whether you will support showing a thumbnail of incoming picture messages so we can respond now then check email later for full res? Thanks! Looking forward to the next update.",2 months ago,"Also any indication of when we might see a preview of what the directions tool will look like?

Bah; sorry; been ages since I've been on here so questions keep popping. When are we locked in to color choice? I picked black for now because that seems like a safer bet but mostly because there don't seem to be a ton of pics of both prototypes yet. Any indication when we'll get a few videos maybe of each in use? Maybe in the next update?

Hey Thomas; welcome back and thanks for the kind words!  I'll try to answer your questions as best I can with our current status. As for incoming messages; right now we're just building out the icon indication but forwarding and/or preview are still on the table as potential features to add; but no final decision at the moment. As for all tools; we spent last week with our software team mapping out the main tools we want and we're bringing on more help to speed that up which is exciting...

...I was planning to share some of the UX sketches for a few of the tools in the next update. They are not yet built; but it's exciting to start to see how they might work! As for color choice there will be a confirmation email about two weeks or so prior to shipping in which we will confirm your address and color. We won't be able to ship the phone until we get that confirmation and that would be the last chance to switch color or opt out (refund)....

...We definitely plan to have a ton of photos/videos of the phone available sooner than later; it's just that we haven't had the final hardware prototypes yet  and the software is still alpha/beta so we've been holding off on sharing too much as it won't reflect the final product so well. Thanks for understanding!

Perfect; thanks for the update! I just took the recent survey and definitely answered the MMS question with the ""I'd prefer to see a thumbnail even if it looks like garbage"" option. So happy you all added emoji. Is that limited to incoming? How many are you planning to support? Also; any indication of directions' availability at launch? Really interested to see how a directions app will work on the Light Phone. As for not showing pics of in-progress work; given past reactions here I agree.

Hi Thomas; Emojis are currently incoming only. We're really *hoping* (and expanding our software team/resources) to have directions as well as one or two other tools by launch. It is too early to say that it will be there for sure; but it is what we are internally working towards. We'd love to have that for launch. Thanks for understanding!"
Hi Joe;I have been waiting more than a year. I just can not keep waiting. The technology is changing too fast. Is it possible to request a refund? Thanks.,2 months ago,Yep; please email us at support@thelightphone.com. Sorry that we were not able to hit our initial April shipping goal; thanks for understanding.
What are the odds the coloring/glass/eink comes close to what the initial sketches look like? Most of the prototypes look pretty terrible with the contrast of the two blacks being very off.,2 months ago,Hi Christian; The recent prototypes; although not final; are more accurate to what the final product will look like. I'm sorry that it is disappointing to you; and we can of course offer you a refund if you are no longer interested (email us at support@thelightphone.com). We've done everything we possibly could to make the screen and front glass match and we feel that we've gotten closer than any other e-ink product on the market; but only so much is possible. Thanks for understanding.
Any updates on the beta testing?,2 months ago,Hey Ian! We've been full speed testing/bug squashing for the past two months; but we haven't yet shared phones with any backers. Nothing has slowed down on the software side; but we're trying to see how many beta phones we can get built before pre-MP and it's this schedule that Kai and team are currently sorting and I'm waiting on their feedback so I can post our next update hopefully later this week or early next. Thanks for understanding!
Is it possible to request a refund? Thank you,2 months ago,Yep; please email us at support@thelightphone.com. Thanks again for taking the time to back our project; hopefully our paths cross again one day.
Hi Joe;That page that sells fake Light Phones is back up.https://waspshops.com/product/light-phone-2-minimalist-4g-phone/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_qvB3YTX4QIVDtVkCh2JUQV0EAQYASABEgLQgPD_BwE,2 months ago,Thanks for sharing; quite frustrating. Cheers!
Hey Joe;Sorry about this but I'd like a refund. Nothing on your part and I may still buy after good reviews. Thanks!,2 months ago,Hi Ryan;  please email us at support@thelightphone.com and we can get your refund sent to you. Thanks again!
Hey Joe;Just to let you know that I backed off 4 months ago seeing the early prototype.  You refunded me.  Many thanks.  But what I saw recently was so good looking that I'm back and submitted my pledge... again... Can't wait to get my hands on your device.  Keep on the good work!,2 months ago,Thanks; Patrick; glad to have you back!
"Just wanted to chime in with everyone else to say thanks for the hard work. I'd also like to encourage everyone who is asking for myriad features (email; podcasts; synced calendars; etc) to be open to the possibility of ""going light"" - if not permanently then at least for as long as it  takes someone to write their desired apps. My daily driver is a Punkt MP02 & I was really surprised by how easy it was to wean myself away from all the features I thought were total deal-breakers; & how...",2 months ago,"... pleasurable the day-to-day experience of being really light on features actually is. I thought I'd die without Google Maps; but turns out that I'd just forgotten how to navigate in my own city. Music is an absolute must for me: I got a Mighty audio player & love that I get to carefully curate my music choices again. I need a calendar: picked up...

... a paper day planner & turns out I have a much sharper memory for appointments & tasks when I handwrite them. Of course it means figuring out workarounds & evidently people draw the line in different places; but I imagine that a lot of your backers will be pleasantly surprised to discover which ""I absolutely cannot live without"" smartphone features they can jettison; & how enjoyable the alternatives can be!

Hi Christine; Seriously appreciate the note and your support of our project. What you are saying rings true to my experience as well over the past two months of testing the Light Phone II as my only phone. Something like not having directions can be empowering when you are able/forced to figure it out on your own. I actually also have the little Mighty player and I get such a deep satisfaction out of using my sketchbook...

...Certainly some minor inconveniences along the way; especially being that I'm using such an early prototype; but overall the peace of mind and mental clarity it has given me is so powerful I can't imagine going back to having a smartphone full time. I think it's also true about the alternatives not just being sub par to the smartphone but many times more enjoyable. The music player has physical buttons to skip the song; the sketchbook becomes this precious artifact when filled up over weeks...

... My texting has become more intentional. I bring my film camera everywhere too. It's just such a more enjoyable tool ergonomically for taking a photograph than holding up a flat glass screen. It takes more meaningful (subjective opinion) photographs; and it doesn't sit inside my phone in my pocket; but on my side with a strap making it quicker to snap photos on the go. It becomes my focus of a long walk; while the phone sits silently in my pocket. Thanks again for sharing; cheers!"
Hi! I finally became a backer (after joining the waitlist on your site; then realizing that was only for the original LP). Question--does the color I selected affect the timing (i.e.; will one color be ready sooner than the other)?  So excited--I have never wanted a smartphone (why bother when I have laptops & landlines both at work and home); but it's getting hard to manage daily communications without being able to text. Love that the LP2 provides what I need/want without the distractions!,2 months ago,Hi Jennifer; Thanks for backing!! Good question and one we haven't talked about yet. I actually don't have a final answer yet; as we are still ramping up and planning for mass production; but with our first Light Phone there was a minor difference in timing between the two models of ~2 weeks. This may not be the case this time around; we will have a slightly bigger assembly line and may be able to kick off both colors simultaneously. I'll make sure to relay to everyone as soon as I know more.
Hi Joe;I was wondering about ability of the LT2 to store a file with QR code and show it on screen. The possibility of staying light even when travelling; going to a concert or anywhere with e-ticket would make a lot easier to ditch smartphone altogether :)Anyways; good luck with the progress; guys!,2 months ago,Hey! It's not in our current roadmap; but we have certainly taken note of the idea as a few others have also asked about it; so it's possible that maybe one day it will be an available option. It's not currently a priority but I really appreciate you taking the time to share that feedback. Cheers!
Hey Joe; im one of your french backers ! can you confirm the following points:- calls (incl handless) / sms- time / date / alarm- short calendar / notes- 4g hotspot (to connect iPad for ex)- bluetooth (to connect to car handless kit for ex)- torch ?- gps (if i understood) ?Thanks a lot!,2 months ago,Currently the core OS that the phone comes with out of the box there will be calls/sms/time/date/alarm (single alarm only) & hotspot / bluetooth are available in settings. There is a GPS; and we are working really hard to try to have an optional directions tool included by launch; but that is 100% confirmed yet. I'm not sure what torch refers to; I'm sorry. Calendar/notes would also be optional tools that we are considering but may not be available by our initial launch. Hope that makes sense
"I'm curious; would it be possible for us to use a pre-existing ringtone? Like; if I had an mp3 sound/ring that was short enough; could I somehow use it as a ringtone on the LP2?Also; as far as calendars go; my personal ideal is to see the month at a glance and know what day of the week it is (ex: ""Fri; April 19"") I don't need to see appointments/events; I just like a quick idea of the date. No big deal if these things won't happen; I just figured I'd express interest.Take care!",2 months ago,"Hi Crystle;  Thanks for following up. At the moment we don't have any plans/way to upload custom ringtones to the phone; but we will have a few options to choose from. As for calendar; there is a setting currently to add the date/day of week to the ""lock"" screen of the phone (when you wake it and see the the time). Wishing you a wonderful weekend :)"
Wondering if Im missing updates via email-what return address would they be coming from? Thanks!,2 months ago,"Hey; good question I had to double check that. It appears as though they send from a ""noreply@indiegogo.com"" and when you reply they come to our support email (info@ or support@thelightphone.com). I'm really sorry if you have not been getting these for whatever reason!"
Hi! I was one of the earlier backers and received an email a while ago about beta testing but havent received phone yet. Expected it in April? Wondering when should I expect ? Cant wait ! Thanks!,2 months ago,Shipping timeline has shifted and we are now looking at July; I'm really sorry that you didn't receive our earlier email about this in regular updates; we tried to let everyone  know asap and will continue to do so incase there are any other changes to timeline. I hope this doesn't come as too much of a disappointment; we're eager to share the phones with everyone!
Hey Joe and team; I just wanted to offer you all some praise for how well you're handling the communication on this project. I've backed other projects in the past and far and away this is the best I've seen. You've had a nice balance of periodic thorough updates and being really responsive to questions here in the comments. Keep up the good work.No response needed - use that time to do something useful for the project,2 months ago,Thank you for the note; it's genuinely appreciated :) Wishing you a wonderful weekend!
Hi! I was just wondering what the use is for the 4g on the phone? Im currently looking for a new carrier for my phone services once ive The light phone 2 here in Holland.Just to be sure if I really need a 4g connection,2 months ago,We chose to use 4G although we aren't sending large amounts of data because it was a reliable and universal network. Our original Light Phone was limited to 2G and we found that in some regions it didn't perform as well as we'd hoped. 4G will give us the possibility to include some of the optional tools we'll be exploring like navigation or ride-share as well. Hope that makes sense!
Hi; new backer here; this thing looks great. Someone below voted for Podcasts: I strongly endorse that feature; too. My dream scenario is iPhone at the office (for desktop WhatsApp) and LP2 everywhere else. In fact I tried a setting like that last summer with Nokia 3310 but the shitty 90s (UX) design of the product destroyed it for me. Can't wait to get the Lightphone 8),2 months ago,Cheers; thanks for the feedback and support Leo! Hope all is well.
Also; new update within the next few days?,2 months ago,Unlikely in next few days; but maybe more likely by end of next week. Thanks for understanding!
Is the project still on track for the phones to begin shipping out in July? Is there any chance of the release date getting bumped up?,2 months ago,Still on track; but many moving parts and want to be honest that there is always a chance of minor bumps in the hardware process; and should things get pushed we will be quick to notify everyone. Any bumps would likely be minor; maybe days/weeks but not months. Hope that makes sense!
I want to hear your new news. Has delivery started? If you are delayed; I wonder when delivery will be done. Support your product!,2 months ago,Hello! Have you been able to see our regular updates? They should be arriving to the email provided at the time of backing; but sometimes they end up in spam/junk folders. You can see our latest updates in the updates tab here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2/x/17193706#/updates/all . We have not started delivery and are expecting to fulfill our pledges in July. Best; Joe
Hi Light. Looking forward to my device . meanwhile something I think is a key user insight from a Punkt MP02 user - I love everything about not having a smart phone EXCEPT lack of calendar - the main reason to carry another device around each day is to check my schedule. SO if there is a way to get a Google calendar feed viewed on your interface it would beat my Punkt for a place in my pocket every day. I know its been on your list of might-dos but I am voting to put it near the top! Cheers,2 months ago,"Appreciate that feedback Eric; and I can totally see where you are coming from. Just a minor follow question if you don't mind; do you imagine such a tool would show one's full calendar or simply the next few (maybe 3-5) events? Thanks for any input; looking forward to sharing the phone with you!

Cheers Joe(I dont know how you get any work; given you are so incredibly responsive to messages!) I would be happy with view only; schedule (scroll) format eg next 3-5 events so I know where I need to be next. For me it is really what's next (as I keep my schedule and to-do list outside my head; per GTD thinking).BUT its easy to imagine users wanting ability to add/edit events; ie full calendar. Maybe have options for lite/heavier via the self-managed add-ons? But lite works for me.

Thanks for the feedback that's helpful. It's always quite the balance game of keeping things simple and trying to add the functionality that every user can see themselves wanting. It's been a such an interesting conversation to have amongst ourselves and with our backers. Thanks again for being a part of the process and supporting our project; hope all is well."
Joe;This may have already been mentioned; but is there a way to answer light phone 2 texts on your Mac? Is there an app to connect and sync them? Is that in development. Similar to the iMessage function.,2 months ago,"Hi Ethan; Initially we don't have a way to do so; as much as I would also love that (typing on a my laptop is much more preferable than any touchscreen). There are two ways we imagine we may be able to make such a thing happen; but both require a decent amount of engineering resources and we likely won't be able to really dive into that until after launch. Thanks for understanding and appreciate the feedback!

Joe;Thanks for the engagement. I am not worried about this before launch. Just curious about it being in the pipe.So it's possible this would be a feature after launch? That would be amazing! I love this phone concept and can't wait to replace my iPhone.

Not much of an update; but we did have an idea this weekend that we'll keep playing with where you can control the Light Phone OS from a computer (we were using a third party dev tool) when it's plugged in. It's not syncing to your computer; but allows you to text from a full size keyboard of your computer. The non-syncing is actually a plus for us because syncing messages poses some security questions; but it would lack the wireless convenience of syncing. Anyway; just a thought; cheers."
Hi! I just want to express appreciation for the project team  and the community. I was a late-adopter of smart phones and now I can be an early ditcher! This phone is exactly what I have been hoping for. (I plan to carry a wifi iPad when I want more tools.) Team: you are brave and wise to take on this project. I am a visual/UX designer and I've worked with new software and new hardware and both at once  it is like diving into a black hole. I get it. So just keep going and trust your instincts!,2 months ago,Thanks so much for the kind words! Seriously appreciate your support. It can seem like diving into a black hole at times; that's for sure; but at least there is a light (phone) at the other end to look forward to hehe. Sorry for the bad joke. All the best; Joe
Hey Joe; I just wanted to make you aware that this website appears to be selling either fake Light Phone 2s; or maybe even stolen beta prototypes; and they are using YOUR images to do so.https://waspshops.com/product/light-phone-2-minimalist-4g-phone/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_qvB3YTX4QIVDtVkCh2JUQV0EAQYASABEgLQgPD_BwE,2 months ago,"Thank you for this; Richard!  We are looking into it.

Very frustrating; thanks so much for pointing that out. We hope to be able to get that taken down ASAP.

No problem; thanks for the reply

Looks like the page was taken down and the person selling the fakes has been suspended! Success!"
Light2     Hello; there is an international version of the product. What version is the Chinese user's version?,2 months ago,"Can products switch languages?

Currently the phone is only available in English language. Thanks for understanding! We'd love to support other languages in due time; but as a small team we don't want to over promise what we can realistically achieve for launch. If this makes the phone no longer usable for you; we can always offer a refund if you email us at support@thelightphone.com . Best; Joe

Hello; Joe. Return is required to send mail without reply

Hello; Joe. Need to return goods

Mail not responded"
I'm quite happy to wait until July for the phone to be even better. Sure; I'd like to have it right now; but I can wait.,2 months ago,
The excitement grows everyday seeing the mockups again and again. Iev ordered the White version and have been waiting for almost a year or so. Honestly I can even wait another year considering that the team is taking extreme care and thought in the product. I am currently an Iphone SE user and Light2 will be a perfect secondary phone. Smart; Minimalistic and Elegant in every bits. Carve it to perfection guys and PLEASE DONT RUSH IT!,2 months ago,
Agreed with Michael Tava and David McAfee below. The stated delivery target is July. This is a complex project and the project team have been more than forthcoming with relevant and timely information. We need to realize and accept that by asking the same questions which have already been answered in email updates and responses to questions asked below; we are diverting time resources that the project team could be using to work on more pressing matters.  Thanks. Looking forward to the phone,2 months ago,
When I funded the product; the delivery date was in April.  If it's delayed; I'd like to get a refund. I can't wait anymore. Please tell me the refund procedure.,2 months ago,It is delayed from April initially shipping goal. You can email us at support@thelightphone.com and we can help to refund your entire pledge; thanks again for supporting our project! Hope that our paths cross again and sorry to disappoint with a delay.
Hi Joe - can you change my pledge to just 1 phone instead of 2 and refund the difference?  With what I need to do for work; the LightPhone just won't be sufficient but my wife still wants it.Thanks!-jonathan,2 months ago,"Hi Jonathan; Can you email us at support@thelightphone.com; we should be able to do this for you no problem. Cheers!

done!  Thanks!"
Following on David's comment below mine; this entire process has many moving parts that we as backers are not aware of. Give it more time; especially since we are not in the July date yet as mentioned in the previous update. Looking forward to this phone.,2 months ago,Cheers; Michael. Well said; there are many; many moving parts indeed. We try to share the most important aspects with our backers without overwhelming everyone with a novel every month haha. Everything is moving along quickly and we are so excited to share the phone with everyone too! It's certainly been busy times over here; and I will get an update out as soon as we have some breathing room; but our priority is keeping development/testing moving full speed!
For those commenting; the plan/timeline was discussed in update 15 (January update) which mentioned that shipping would commence in late June with fulfilment in July.,2 months ago,Thanks; David!
no update ;we are close to may .......,2 months ago,We've been sharing regular updates to all of our backers; which if you have not been receiving you can always check in the updates tab of the campaign. I'm sorry for any confusion; but our timeline has shifted and we are not able to ship the phones this April as we initially had optimistically hoped. If this no longer is acceptable; we are offering full refunds if you email us at support@thelightphone.com.
we are almost a year from to launch of this item; What is the planning? I'm considering to ask a refund.,2 months ago,I hope that you have been receiving our regular updates; if not you can see those in the updates tab in the campaign. Our timeline has shifted for shipping to everyone; and if this timeline no longer works we can offer a full refund if you email us at support@thelightphone.com. Thanks again for the support and hope all is well.
As far as cases go; I would prefer something simple that increases the size of the phone as little as possible. Something like that would work fine and provide enough cushion to keep the phone in good condition if/when dropped (I use this on my current smart phone). https://smile.amazon.com/ULAK-Transparent-Flexible-Shock-Absorption-Packaging/dp/B07584QZKT/ref=sr_1_25?keywords=Phone+case+iPhone+5s&qid=1555207133&s=gateway&sr=8-25,2 months ago,Thanks for sharing! One of our team members also really liked the idea of a bumper case. Right now we're exploring cases; but looking at a more full phone silicone wrap that would cover the back of the phone as well. But we'll definitely keep this link around as inspiration!
John you're right light phone 2 should be simple phone call; sms; alarm; calendar and maybe one more thing that's all,2 months ago,Cheers!
Are we on track???,2 months ago,I hope you have been receiving our regular updates. We are no longer going to be shipping this April as we initially hoped for when we launched the campaign. Sorry for the news; but we believe it's in the interest of a better product. If this timeline push is no longer acceptable we can always offer a full refund if you email us (support@thelightphone.com).
Looking forward to a possible Beta test! I am totally excited about this phone! I know most folks don't want the ability to receive and view pictures but I want to put in a poke to (possibly) include the ability to post a picture of the family/dogs/whatever on the phone screen itself. Even if it only shows in black and white; that would be exciting to have the ability to do. Regardless; I am very much looking forward to the phone!,2 months ago,Hi Byron; Appreciate the feedback; it feels like a delicate thing to consider; but we are certainly not taking it off the table. Hope all is well!
If Verizon connectivity is not a possibility by the time these phones are ready; will refunds be available? I love this phone for my middle school child but I dont want to have to set up a whole new cell plan for her.,2 months ago,Yep; of course; but we really expect that not to be an issue and have been working with Verizon to get all necessary certifications in place. Thanks!
Good luck with Beat test!!,2 months ago,Cheers!
A few months back; I contributed for two Light Phones at $250 each; one for myself and one for my oldest daughter. Now my oldest son says he wants one as well. Can I just increase my contribution by another $250 and add a third Light Phone?,2 months ago,Hi Gregory; If you email us at support@thelightphone.com we can find a way to make that possible for you!
I agree with John.  Please keep it LIGHT.   That's what makes you special.  You can never be all things to all people anywayLinda Rose,2 months ago,Well said and I do agree! Just incase it wasn't clear; just want to remind everyone that any additional functionality beyond calls; messages and alarm are completely optional and if you'd prefer you can avoid ever adding any features at all; and we think that's great!
Please don't add too many functions/Apps.I myself prefer a LIGHT phone; If not; my iPhone is good enough and who bothers to have your light phone?,2 months ago,Good point!
<3,2 months ago,Cheers!!
"Finally pledged after following for quite some time; so looking forward! My main concern with going light for good (besides GPS and losing picture messages to the void; which many many others have brought up) is PODCASTS! Some will say this doesn't fit with the concept of ""going light""; but for me; podcasts are a great productivity tool. I'm not a tech person; but my initial thought is would it be possible to integrate podcast RSS feed subscription into the user dashboard website?",2 months ago,I'm not super familiar with RSS but it seems like it's something pretty standardized and I agree that (in my not-so-tech person opinion) that it seems like it should be possible. Thanks for the suggestion; hopefully we can make something like this work for you!
Hi guys! Not sure if it has been asked; but what is the feasibility of adding a notepad feature? It would be nice to be able to jot down some thoughts; on the off chance I forgot my paper notebook. Thanks!,2 months ago,"It's certainly something we've heard a good amount of interest in and will definitely explore. My initial concerns were around the small screen size; whether the keyboard would be effective for typing long notes/thoughts and the experience of viewing the archive of notes. We have some ideas for maybe note to self that would email either voice memos or written messages to yourself for later viewing too. Not the number 1 priority tool; but we will explore what makes sense for sure!

Thank you for the quick reply! That all sounds good; cant wait to see the final product!"
Would you please list all the features that will be available in LP II thus far (wifi; maps; GPS...etc.)? Also; will it be available in all carriers (I'm in the US)?,2 months ago,As of right now; we have only finished the core functionality of calls; messages and an alarm. The other optional tools we plan to have a few by launch and continue to roll them out on going. It is still too early to tell what exactly will be available; but directions seems to be one of the most universally requested tools and one we are starting to explore what will be possible with. In the US it'll work with all carriers except Sprint (and MVNOs that use Sprint networks). Thanks!
Thank you for the great product ....I am looking forward to July.I am from Japan ...Is it compatible with Japanese input and Japanese display?,2 months ago,At the moment; we only have English language input and display but we hope in due time to support other languages; but as a small team we are hesitant to overpromise. Thanks for understanding!
any update on the Beta status?thanks,2 months ago,"Trying to finalize schedule/quantity of available phones so we can start to pick and reach out to various beta testers. All the while we have been internally continuing to beat these phones up with testing and have been sprinting to squash all of the bugs that we've been experiencing along the way. April 25th is our goal for a beta-ready software build. Thanks!

thanks; can't wait"
I have AT&T family plan. Can I just use my current iPhone SIM and put it into lightphone?,2 months ago,Yep! That shouldn't be a problem.
I need music in my life so much; a wonderfull tool,2 months ago,
Hi; so excited to see these! Wondering will there be any sort of cases available? I am getting them for my pre-teens.,2 months ago,We are planning to at least have one type of case available for launch. We've just started high level exploration of those and everyone will have the opportunity to add them to their pledge prior to our shipping.
Also will this be waterproof and or water resistant??,2 months ago,"Sorry just read the story over all questions answered 

Great; cheers!"
It would be cool to have some kindle software ..is this a possibility??,2 months ago,I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean; but if you are referring to the ability to read books; we're hesitant to think that the Light Phone II would be a good device for reading long form. It is just about the size of a credit card (shape; not thickness) and so it is quite a small screen and at the moment we don't feel it would be adequate for reading. Thanks for understanding.
What happens to picture messages?  Is there a way to forward them to email; will we get a notification that a picture was attached but we can't view it; or will it be a complete mystery?,2 months ago,"Hi Ryan; Currently there is an icon that will notify you that an image was sent; but not a way to view it on the device itself. Forwarding is a really interesting idea we'd like to explore as well; but currently (alpha) it does not have that option yet. In theory we could make it possible to view the image on the device itself; but we're very hesitant to do so and don't have any current plans to. Curious what you would like to have happen? Cheers!

Thanks for the reply!  I think both options are appealing.  Getting things forwarded would be nice for ""important"" pictures; but many people send silly little messages and whatnot which would be perfectly acceptable to view on e-ink with greyscale.  Ideally; I'd like to see both; but I recognize it's more complicated than that."
Will it have an option to bluetooth a headset,2 months ago,Yep there is bluetooth
Would it be possible to show message notifications in a dropdown as they arrive? Also; for many of us ; getting a photo of a child; loved one; or pets provides a happy boost to our day. Why not allow for this joy to continue on the LP2; but only for those who opt in? Going light means limiting email access; so forwarding a photo to email means that we'd only see the message at the end of the day. If photo messages are an optional setting then only those who want them can opt in. It's a Win-Win!,2 months ago,It is technically possible to display the images sent to a user on the Light Phone II; but we've not yet built it and have not decided if it is something we will ever include or not. Currently we're still thinking not. We did ask about it on our last survey to try to get a better idea of how our backers felt; and for the most part everyone seemed to agree about no images on the device. Perhaps it will be a future option; but it's not yet something we're comfortable with. Thanks for understanding
I notice a few public wifi spots in my area have no password required; but need the user (via device) to accept a ToS before using wifi. This means using a browser; which I know the LP2 will not do. I'm wondering; if I go to one of these places and need to; say; add a tool or update to the lightphone via wifi; will I be able to connect the LP2? Just wondering. Not a dealbreaker.,2 months ago,I'm not honestly sure; but you are correct that there is not a browser so it may not be possible. FWIW; to add a tool you would need to use the user dashboard website either from a smartphone/tablet/laptop; and the Light Phone II does use 4G LTE (data) so wifi or not shouldn't make a difference in updating except maybe a hair faster on wifi. I hope that makes sense!
Any chance to add a pedometer? Simple but helpful.,2 months ago,Hmm that's interesting idea; I'm not sure if it will be possible to do so accurately with our hardware; but we do have a lot of the gyro sensors that I think are required so perhaps a future option. I've taken note regardless; thanks for sharing.
"I just read Cal Newport's book titled ""Digital Minimalism"". He does a good job of explaining the importance of digital minimalism while also embracing technology for purposeful endeavors. I feel fortunate to have had a smartphone free childhood. With a 2 year old I worry that humans will evolve to ask Google first and think second. Humanity may become more advanced and life more simple; but I'm concerned that we'll be leaving our humanity behind.",3 months ago,"A great read! I love Digital Minimalism because I think it also offers not just the study of the effects like many other books but some practical tips for ""decluttering"" one's digital presence. I agree about smartphone free childhood; it's quite insane to imagine being born into this world today. Thanks for sharing and glad you read that book; Cal is a really nice guy too :)"
"I think the only other element I'd love to add is a GPS; so that my family knows where I am all the time.  Since I ride motorcycle; they feel comfortable when they can pull up gMaps and see my location.If not GPS; then some sort of cell tower ping and then server triangulation for a ""rough"" report back using say; ""a companion light app"" to see the users location without the nee of a GPS.Can't want!  Cheers!!",3 months ago,"can't ""wait""*need.. sorry; excited.  ;)

We do have GPS in the device (an FCC requirement actually for emergency phone calls ); we just have not yet enabled it in any such feature yet; but we do plan to offer that as an option eventually as we've also heard from users who are afraid of losing their Light Phones or parents who similarly want to track their child's location. By default the GPS is completely off logically and one would have to opt in to have their location tracked and viewable in user dashboard. Hope that makes sense!"
"oh serious!  (re: latest update = ""... connect to wifi; set passcode..;"")If this device can truly be a hot spot; I think it will be a perfect replacement for my smart device.  It will have the minimal elements I need for comms (phone and sms) and when / if I need more; I can make it a hotspot for that bigger device that's just floating around somewhere; in a bag or a drawer or wherever... but that ""bigger"" device will never be in my hands at all times!",3 months ago,Cheers!
Strong preference against hotspotOwning Light Phone is an important part of controlling my internet usage / access. I've shut internet off at home. And on my iphone (calls+txt only). In my view; at a fundamental level; hotspot functionality effectively turns the Light Phone2 into a full-featured phone - bcs the Light Phone can then empower any other device you have - tablet; computer; whatever - to become a full-featured device. I do NOT want full-featured devices. I want LIGHT devices.,3 months ago,"Hey Christopher; Really appreciate the feedback. I do totally see where you are coming from; and I personally tend to agree in that I would not likely be one to use it as a hotspot. That being said; we understand there are many different users; and such a functionality (hotspot tool) would be something a user could optional download and of course would never have to use. It's a fine line to balance in making this a useful device for a variety of users without taking away from its lightness...

...I think at least in the case you mention of having a tablet or computer; the tablet of computer wouldn't live in one's pocket and be pulled out every waking second in line; on the toilet; etc. but hopefully in more intentional moments like with an hour to kill at the airport. I personally would rather read a book than try to do something stressful like email at the airport; but my point is just that we don't see as entirely hypocritical to phone. I think it's great that you don't want it btw!

Hi Joe; I'm impressed by your response rate/speed. Thanks for that. In terms of the ""LIGHT-ness"" of something; my feeling is that LIGHTer devices are more encouraging of intentional moments/living. And the hotspot functionality feels like an enabler of all of too many of the habits and 'features' that I'm trying to escape. Also; for something to come short of being ""entirely hypocritical"" still leaves room for it to be almost completely hypocritical; which isn't much... "
+1 for hotspot toggle.-1 for Ride Share. Many of us would prefer not to be walled into a particular ride share. Its just one thing that not everyone uses.+1 for an options package install system. Example: Plug Lightphone into the computer. Open a Light Phone Program; Choose features you want to add/remove by selecting those features; then click to update the phone based on your selection. This lets the users have the freedom to add/remove services. True minimalist phone experience.,3 months ago,"Hey Michael; Thanks for the feedback. Just want to point out that any additional features ('optional tools') that we make available; like ride share perhaps; would always be completely optional. There is a website we're calling User Dashboard in which you can wireless add the optional tools you'd like to your Light Phone. We'd never want a user to have unnecessary tools by any means. Hope that makes sense!

Hi Joe. Thank you for the prompt reply and apologies if I glazed over that info on your page before commenting.

Not a problem!"
+1 for adding hotspot toggle (on/off) to wireless settings page; as per your response to Matthew A Paulsen's post,3 months ago,
Hey lightphone team; say I get picked as one among those lucky few beta testers. Will my whole order (4 phones) be fulfilled; or just one? It may be preferable for just one to be sent; because whereas I am all about testing and providing feedback; my family wants to be able to just use it.Also; you mentioned in a previous response that hotspots will be a tool. In your next update would you be able to give some details? Like will we set it up in Dashboard (password/network name); or from lp2?,3 months ago,"Hi Matthew; As for beta; we were planning it would be just 1 of the 4 devices; because there will be such a limited supply we want to get as much variety of testers in various regions etc. Hotspot would be added to the device from the user dashboard site (unless we ultimately decide it makes sense to be in the settings by default in the ""Bluetooth & Wifi"" preferences) and you'd likely be able to change password/network name on the LP2 itself; but we haven't 100% finalized it."
Some sites support SMS but adding Authenticator apps support would be helpful.,3 months ago,"It's something we may be able to explore and we've taken note of the idea (and actually included it in our previous survey to understand how to prioritize it in our 'tool' roadmap). Thanks!

Thanks; Joe! Where can I find the roadmap?Can we add date along with the time on the home screen?

We have not finalized the roadmap; we have an internal idea of what we want to prioritize based on feedback from everyone through surveys and conversations like this; but we haven't yet been able to work with our software team to map it out on a timeline (they are still heads down getting the core functionality flushed all of the way out; which is number one priority atm). Adding date to home screen is a planned option in the settings as part of that core functionality that you can expect.

Thanks; Joe; for your quick responses! Really appreciate it."
I am super excited for LP2. I have been using an iPhone SE for the last year  but was really tired of the battery life and realized that I didn't use all of its features. I think that Light could be the answer.Also; thank you for the updates. I am really looking forward to the next one. I did have one question regarding receiving images via MMS. Since LP2 has no camera; it obviously can't take photos. Will it still be able to receive photos; emojis; and other multimedia via text? Thanks!,3 months ago,"Also; one quick follow up question regarding USA Cell Carriers. I read from the update that the LP2 will be available on all of the main networks except Sprint. I was curious if it will be available for some of the secondary carriers like U.S. cellular? I grew up in a small town on the west coast and wondered if I would need to switch carriers when I wanted to activate my LP2. Thanks again for all the great work.

Hi Evan! Thanks for the support. The Light Phone II does accept emojis; group messages; but currently we are not planning to display images sent to the device but rather show an icon so that you realize something was sent. It is possibly we can do something different here if there is an overwhelming need for it from our users. As for carriers; there are many smaller carriers (like the Light plan we'll offer) that ""rent"" from the larger 3 networks and those will be compatible too."
LPII was my first investment in crowdfunding.I really like the concept;However; I do not invest by concept alone.When I sympathize with the concept;I tried to delete the application of the smartphone as much as possible.However; the battery ran out soon and it was not cool at all ...Since LPII is designed to achieve that concept;Simple; keep batteries long; and cool!I look forward to LPII from Japan!,3 months ago,Thank you for the support and kind words :)
Hey Joe; how does the screen refresh rate compare to that of an amazon kindle (8th generation; with the slightly depressed screen)?,3 months ago,It's still a work in progress in constantly optimizing; but we're confident it will be comparable to all of the other latest e-ink technology devices. If anything maybe even a little faster hopefully.
HiI've not been getting the email updates of late (received 1 I think). Worried these are going in my junk. Can you confirm the email address they are being sent out on? Don't want to miss anything important like shipping updates :)Thank you,3 months ago,"Just sent you a test email to the address we have on file. If you don't receive it; please email support@thelightphone.com and we can make any changes to your pledge details.

Thank you Joe; I got that mail so hopefully all OK. Probably need to check in more on the project. Whats the new release date for the phone now?

We're expecting to be delivering most of the phones in July to our backers at this point and will keep everyone posted asap if something changes."
hi! is carddav (and possibly caldav) sync a possibility? (I know with the last phone there was manual input from the desktop for new contacts.)thank you!,3 months ago,"There will be a way to upload a batch of contacts using the user dashboard website. Cheers!

I'm guessing the same utility will allow us to export contacts? Thank you again. Way faster reply than I was expecting. Props.

Not sure if we have a way to export them from the Light Phone II yet; but that should be a straightforward functionality for us to add as well. Thanks for the feedback."
On a different subject; in recent photos the border between the e-ink screen and the rest of the front casing is very obvious; with a thin but distinct shadow along the boundary. Do you know if that will be the case for the final screen; or will the border be more subtle; appearing as a single; smooth matte surface across the entire front of the phone? I'm very much looking forward to the phone either way; I'd just prefer the latter; and am curious about what to expect. Again; thanks!,3 months ago,"While it's not final; it's not far off from how the final phone will look in regard to the shadow. We've tried to explain this in a previous update/blog post (https://medium.com/the-light-phone/why-a-screen-eca598f37159). There is no physical seem to the touch at all. We've tried our absolute best (we think it's closer than any other e-ink product) to make it match in color and reflection as well as reduce the stack up (which causes the shadow). I'd of course prefer the latter as well!...

...The E-ink screen module cannot possibly fit the entire front face of the screen; which is a current (potentially forever) limitation of that technology. The shadow is a result of the physics of the screen stack up. If we removed the front light; the shadow would decrease a little; but we feel that no front light would seriously effect usability of the phone. From many angles the shadow is not very obvious; but it is not invisible by any means. Thanks for understanding!"
"Hello!  I have a query about the possibility of putting a music playlist or playlists on the device; which has been mentioned multiple times; but usually without any firm details. Is there any more you can say on that front? If a music feature is still on the cards; would that involve just plugging in a micro sd card loaded up with multiple files as the ""playlists"" (my preferred option); or something more along the lines of Spotify or other streaming service; or both; or...? Thanks!",3 months ago,"Hi Samuel; Sorry to not have many firm details; but we want to remain transparent about our current stage in development. Ideally there would be multiple options in due time; on our surveys we've learned that some users want a way to simply add songs/files they own; others want to potentially take advantage of a streaming platform. Our high level study makes it clear that Spotify would require cooperation from their team in order to make it work; so that becomes more complicated...

...for being able to add one's songs into a tool; it's a little more straightforward and likely will be available prior to a streaming platform collaboration. There is no MicroSD slot; but we imagine one would sync one's songs using the use dashboard website and wifi on the Light Phone II. It would be stored locally on the Light Phone II; and would likely have a limited amount of space (a few gbs). Hope that gives you a better idea of the future (optional) music functionality."
Hi! Excited for this project and finally getting my lightphone. I need to change my shipping address. How do I do that?,3 months ago,If you email us at support@thelightphone.com we can make a note of the address change on our records; but regardless we will be emailing everyone prior to shipping (and we actually won't ship without confirmation) to make sure we have up to date shipping address and color preferences. Hope the move is as painless as those can be :)
Hi; will the phone be compatible with Google Fi technology?,3 months ago,"In theory it should be compatible from a antenna/network spec; and we just ordered a Google Fi SIM to test. I'm hesitant to say for sure it is compatible being relatively unfamiliar with their network myself until we do this test. They list so few devices as compatible; I'm not sure if there is something unique installed on those devices? We'd like to be compatible with as many carriers as possible ideally; and hope that there are no issues there. Thanks for understanding!

I am pretty sure the sim will work but apparently the ""compatible phone"" have some sore of hardware or software that allows them to switch between 3 different networks. It also allows the phone to work abroad. If this networking switching and traveling feature works with LP2 that would be amazing. I am planning on traveling soon and wold love to use the LP2 while doing so.

Hi Adam; Firstly we did just get our test SIM. YOu need the googlefi app to set it up; so we set it up on a smartphone and then we inserted it to the Light Phone II and it did work. There were some funky characters coming at the end of text messages; that we forwarded along to investigate; not sure if that is something Google adds for their info and then hides from end user in their compatible devices or not. But we'll keep playing with that...

It is unlikely; though perhaps not impossible (would require their support I imagine) that we'd have that software you mention; but I'm honestly not too familiar. Side note: unfortunately for traveling; the Light Phone II is not the best option. It's not able to work in every single region of the world (we have two SKUs that optimize for North America and then the Rest of the World; and though the phone may get coverage in the other regions; it may be less strong; spotty or just not work)."
Does it support tetheering like Punkt?,3 months ago,"That's the goal; yes!

Cant wait to get my lightphone!"
What's up Light Phone fam! I have on my calendar that my LPII is supposed to ship this monday April 1st. Am I a 'fool' for thinking that? If so; when should I expect to get my sweet little baby electronic device? Thanks a million. -J,3 months ago,"Hey Jeremiah; Hope all has been well! Seems like maybe you haven't been getting the regular updates; as unfortunately; we're now looking at a July ship date. If you click the updates tab on the campaign; you can read more details about that; and of course if this is a dealbreaker; we'll continue to offer full refunds for anyone no longer interested; just shoot us a note - support@thelightphone.com. Cheers!

Gotcha I will check the updates tab next time and thank you for the nudge in the right direction Joe. I am still super interested and look forward to July. I'll check back as the date approaches to see if there are subsequent updates. Have the best day! -J"
Hi GuysWill I be able to use the LP II as a 4G modem / tethering ?Regards,3 months ago,Hi Simon; That is our plan to allow the phone to be used as a hot spot.
Joe;Will there be a way to import contacts from iPhone or Android? Also will there be a way to connect the phone to email? (I actually use email more than text)Thanks!,3 months ago,Hi Ethan; We want to make it as easy as possible to import one's contacts. It will be handled through the user dashboard website for the phone and we plan to have support for apple/google stored contacts as well as uploading a batch of contacts from others too. There is no plans for the phone to connect to email; but we do plan to have tethering as an option so you might be able to use the phone in conjunction with tablet/laptop while out if that's helpful. Best; Joe
"I would love to see an SDK as well as some others have said (this is just to port a few very simple personal tools of my own). On the other hand; if you give developers too much power or make it too easy to share apps with each other we'll eventually make the environment too ""heavy"" all over again. An interesting dillema. I personally believe it's the ""app store"" paradigm that causes the heaviness though. Desktop computers have never respulsed me in the way phones do.",3 months ago,Hey! It's certainly an interesting dilemma that we've been thinking about as well. We have some ideas; and are of course open to feedback/suggestions too; but we haven't had the chance to really dive into it at this stage yet. I can relate re:desktop vs smartphone in that way too.
Hi; I just ordered two of these in white. I'm wondering if either color has better visibility? We have the option to change colors; right?,3 months ago,Hello! You will have the option to switch which model you prefer; and at that time we'll have more tangible photos/videos of examples of either model. In the settings; you can also invert the screen itself to white/black background on either model of phone. Hope that makes sense!
"I saw your response to Aaron Pollard that ""at the moment we aren't storing anyone's history outside their device"". THANK YOU. One of the reasons I want to ditch smartphones is that they are one giant vacuum hoovering up data for the surveillance capitalist. I can't tell you how happy I was to read that. Keep up the great work!",3 months ago,"By the way; I signed up for one white phone and one black one. The more I look at the two; I'm leaning to going with two white ones. Am I correct that we can change that before shipment?

Hi Gregory; I like the way you phrased that! (hoovering up data for the surveillance capitalist)... You are correct; we will be following up with every backer prior to shipping to confirm their address and color preference. We won't ship the phone until we get that confirmation. Cheers!"
One concern from the update (which was excellent). The keyboard looks quite small; which is expected given the size of the phone itself. However; you may want to see about moving the SEND button away from the rest of the keyboard buttons; especially away from the backspace arrow. I have sent numerous text messages when I was trying to correct a sentence because of this issue. Given the small size of the keyboard itself; it would be nice to have a little extra room for error!,3 months ago,"In fact; you may want to consider placing the SEND button at the top of the message; on the same line as the X to cancel (although; perhaps not right next to that button); if possible.

(sorry if this is sending twice; weird internet glitch happened)... That's great feedback though and very much appreciated. We did try a few versions in our sketching with it located at the top; and we will certainly consider relocating it. So far in my personal use it hasn't been an issue; but we'd love to get more user feedback regarding that. Also; minor note; the SEND button is filler; there's a nice icon that will replace it :)"
Hey guys; Love what you're doing! Sorry if this has been asked; but I'm not in the US (in Aus) and I saw on the latest update you sent us all the details about Light SIMs and the US carriers etc. Could I please check that the phone will be good to go for international providers / networks?Cheers; keep up the good work dudes.Cam,3 months ago,Hi Cameron; Thanks for the kind words and support! We do plan to have more details about which specific carriers in each country are most compatible; but the phone will certainly work in Australia. The network bands for your info and if you'd like to check with your current or preferred carrier are:  B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28 for the international SKU of the Light Phone II. I'm not sure off the top of my head which exact carriers in Australia that means but we will have that info for launch.
Hi Joe; I'm getting pretty excited now and don't really have any technical questions. Having invested in 4 I'll put my trust in you guys to cross the T's and dot the I's.  How will shipping work? For those of us in Europe can we expect our phones at roughly the same time as the rest of the world? Do you foresee any network issue in central Europe?,3 months ago,Hi Russell; Prior to shipping we will reach out to everyone to confirm their address; color and models (region). Assuming a prompt response the phones will ship out of our distribution center in Chicago (working with Brightstar). Shipping times may take a little longer to get to Europe; and there is a chance that the phone will have to go through customs which may add some time as well. We don't foresee any issues in Europe and plan to have more info about what carriers are most compatible.
Great update. Am excited and looking forward to the device. Hopefully there will be a way to transfer text messages either from an old device onto the new device; or from one light phone to another in the event that one needs to be replaced. Or maybe a backup tool would be useful. I do not know how difficult that would be for your team; though. Hopefully something like that would not be too difficult.,3 months ago,"Hi Aaron; We don't yet (as far as I know) have a way to transfer conversation history between devices. It may not be possible to get some of that from devices like an iPhone (iMessage). Light Phone to Light Phone should be possible; but at the moment we aren't storing anyone's history outside their device which would have to happen I think. We might be able to offer such an (optional) feature to sync history; but we'd need to work out the privacy policy for how that info is handled or stored.

...In a similar vein; if we are able to offer an option to sync one's history; we'd also be able to offer the feature to text from the user dashboard website. There might some other interesting features that become possible in that case as well. At the moment however; I don't think there is a way to easily sync one's history to a new device. Thanks for bringing that up and hope all is well."
Hey; been following you guys for a long time and finally signed up.  Very excited for this.  I know you mentioned that WhatsApp is not going to be available because working with their team is difficult.  My father lives outside the US and we primarily communicate thru WA (along with lots of other friends outside the US).  Could there possibly be a way to at least send a text that a WA message has been received so I could then know to check it on my computer?  For many; WA is an important tool.,3 months ago,"For me; this is even more important than music.  Most Europeans I know communicate with each other solely through WhatsApp; so also important to think about for the European market.

Hi Joseph; I completely see where you are coming form and can understand how Whatsapp is a major form of some users' communication. Especially for international communication. We've heard from many users about the desire for alternative messaging platform support. Our current hesitation in considering it a future option is that we don't yet know if it will be possible to customize it enough for it to work on the Light Phone (may require their support). We've certainly noted it and will explore."
Hi! I saw a few comments where you referenced a React Native SDK. As a developer this is pretty enticing because it would allow me to create apps to fulfill specific needs that might be outside the scope of the default tools; like Telegram for messaging (which my whole family uses and loves) or possibly music streaming. Do you have any status updates or timelines on the availability of an SDK? Thank you!!,3 months ago,"Hi Ty; Awesome to hear that you are also excited about the SDK. I honestly don't have a lot of news on the details or timeline at this time; but the way that we are creating our ""tools"" currently internally we've done so with a future SDK in mind; so hopefully a lot of the work for it will be done when we do work on releasing the SDK. We still need to solve just how exactly those 'tools' are added by a user."
Hi. Is the phone going to be waterproof in some way. My wife just dropped her phone in the toilet. The iPhone didnt servive. I hope the light phone will..?,3 months ago,"The Light Phone II is not going to be waterproof. It is currently rated at IPx3 which is officially defined as resistant to ""water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60 from the vertical shall have no harmful effect."""
looking amazing! another quick question :) are there any plans for some type of low-level backlighting for LP2..? e-ink is the most pleasing and least digital of all the screens; but i know they dont really light up well - and of course ill want to use LP2 after dark; be it for communication or calling a ride - but especially in an emergency - just the idea of being able to answer the phone in the dark is something im curious about..thank you so much; youre doing incredible work!,3 months ago,Hey! We should have made this more clear; but yes; there is a front light so that the phone is visible in dark. You can manually turn it ON/OFF and we plan to have an automatic setting which would use the ambient light sensor to understand the lighting conditions. Appreciate the kind words and support!
hey; awesome product! does texting need to be done sideways?,3 months ago,For now we've limited it to sideways because the size of the phone/screen is so small that we are afraid it would be an inadequate experience in portrait mode. I did test a keyboard in portrait mode in an early test; it was possible to text; but it's much more comfortable sideways. Hope that makes sense!
Is grey still an option or is it just black and white?,3 months ago,"Sorry for the confusion with colors; I'll make sure to clarify that in the next update. There are only two colors of the phone; light grey (the ""whitest"" color of E-ink; as shown in the last update) and black (which is a the darkest shade of E-ink and actually not pure black either). Hope that makes sense!"
I noticed some ghosting in the video of the call. This was mentioned in a previous update with e-ink being optimized for white background. Any thing being done to address this on the black phones? Or is that just inherent with the black background? Really cool to see it coming together!,3 months ago,"Hi Kendall; I should have elaborated more on the ghosting; but I thought it made more sense to see what the final outcome is after our optimization is done to speak about the details. It's true that white background even at this stage has much less noticeable ghosting; but the team seems confident it can improve from where it is now w/ black. Another option is to add more refreshes which would resolve it.  Ghosting is most noticeable in super direct sunlight or with the front light on at night..

For whatever it's worth; I personally think there's something a little charming about the ghosting; but I'm also kind of a print nerd that loves little imperfections of things like that. It is not trying to make an excuse and we are definitely going to try our best to eliminate ghosting as much as possible or completely. Although quite visible at times; it doesn't effect legibility; but it's certainly there. There's a lot of optimization coming; so I look forward to testing and sharing soon!

And incase it wasn't clearly stated; you can invert the colors of either color model in the settings. It's actually already built out and working on my alpha phone because I wanted to be able to see how they both function in a variety of settings easily. Cheers!"
A while ago someone mentioned the importance of being able to go back to the home screen while on a call. I'd like to reiterate and emphasize the importance of such a feature - it is super important when doing to-factor verification; or referring to a text while on a call for an address or phone number. Would it be possible to allow users the ability to use all or most of the phone's functions while on a call? This is a big deal for me; and I am sure it is a big deal for others as well. Thanks!,3 months ago,"*Two-Factor Verification

We certainly need to address it somehow. In the early Alpha builds you were able to navigate out of the call; but the screen had no UX for returning to the call to end it; so that was an issue lol! I've started to sketch how it might work but aren't yet there with a solution I'm happy with. It's not a technical issue; but UX one IMO. I think it's safe to assume you will be able to leave the phone screen on an active call without ending the call and still being able to return to the phone screen."
Also; what carrier do you use in the aplha testing phone that you are currently using? Are you using it exclusively in Brooklyn; or are there other areas (tri-state and beyond) that you've used it in? How has your service been? Any spotty locations? How is service in buildings?Thanks in advance for you answers!,3 months ago,We were predominately using T-Mobile; and Light SIMs (AT&T network). So far I've been impressed with the service; it's been comparable to my iPhone SE that I was using previously. My experience has been limited to Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan; but it was able to work underground at all the same stations that my iPhone could catch signal. It works well in the New Lab (our office) which is pretty terrible for signal in general (og LP didn't get service inside); and so that was relieving!
Great work. I really appreciate the level of detail you're providing in the updates. Only drawback is the updates only make me hungrier for more news! Big ups to you and the rest of the team for all your hard work!,3 months ago,Hi Ravi; Hoping the updates will continue to be more rich as we have more and more tangible things to show leading to launch. Can't wait!
"1.  excellent update; thank you!2. just wanted to say that the transition between smartphone to dumb phone can be tough. I switched to a ""Logic"" phone mid-december; and it took 2-3 weeks to adjust. I suggest that whoever is going straight from smart phone to light phone should try to delete as many apps as possible; and lighten their smartphone to the greatest extent from now in preparation for going light. I also deleted whatsapp two years ago; and also had an adjustment period of a few weeks",3 months ago,Valid point; thanks for the suggestion to the community. I can certainly relate for sure. Even with the original Light Phone for just a few hours you can feel some initial anxiety/withdraw. A lot of users said they found themselves tapping their pockets as if to habitually reach for their smartphone. Overall I think it's a feeling of self-empowerment; but it does come with some minor inconveniences perhaps along the way. For many it's worth it for the freedom and peace of mind long term. Cheers
Digging the Vibraphone; have you guys been listening to Tranquility Base Hotel & Casio much? That album vibe immediately rushed into my head when I heard the tone sounds. As if this phone could not get any cooler!,3 months ago,"Oh sweet; I haven't actually checked it out yet at all; but stoked to give it a listen; thanks! Really glad you're digging the vibraphone too :)

For sure the first 2 tracks use the vibraphone but the whole album has a space-y lounge-y feel as that instrument tends to bring.

Not quite related; but it's always kind of a treat to re-listen to; here's a link to the 1995 Windows booting sound that Brian Eno created: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHa7ZC6Z0. We were reading the brief he received and about his process and found it an interesting problem to solve... ""sonic branding"".  We're thinking of it more in context than as ""branding"" per say because the ringtone is ultimately utilitarian; but how it gets your attention is where our 'light' voice comes in.

Oh that boot brings back some memories! (Another factoid: Eno created the boot sound on a Mac.) Way off tangent but I was literally telling my daughters a few days ago how Bill Gates paid the Rolling Stones a gazillion dollars to use ""start me up"" as their Windows 95 launch song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPyWDMmYJhQ"
Thanks for the updates. Looking good. My main usages would be: callsthreaded textsgroup textsalarm clockcalculatordirections would be a plus,3 months ago,"Wonderful; sounds like a great Light Phone to me! Thanks for sharing the feedback and hope that all is well :)

Thanks for replying. I did have one minor question...more of a curiosity. In calls and texts; I see it's a Helvetica family font. But when in giving the time; it is a different font. I imagine it is the result of some back-end limitation. The sleek and simple style of LP would make me think you would prefer one typesetting throughout. Just a thought.

The font we will be using is Akkurat throughout the entire phone. It's a font designed by the foundry Lineto from Switzerland ( https://lineto.com/ ). They have been really kind and helpful. Actually they even just refreshed the typeface to optimize for smaller screens; so the Light Phone II will be the first to see the fresh cut of Akkurat. Cheers and love the typography questions :)"
Super excited about this project. Two things I would love to see:1) I do a lot of texting in Spanish as well; so even if there isn't a full Spanish keyboard; the ability to put in other characters (accented vowels and ) would be really important2) I'd also love the ability to sync with Google calendar and have basic access to upcoming events (doesn't have to be pretty; but this would prevent me from having to carry a second device at times)Thanks for your work on this exciting project!,3 months ago,"Hi Kyle; Thanks! 1. That's our goal to have special characters available; but it is not currently in our alpha phones. Eventually we'd like to support other languages even deeper; but I think have accented vowels etc. is pretty important. 2. It's definitely something we heard from a lot of backers; a sort of ""reminders"" or ""upcoming events"" perhaps rather than a full fledged feature packed calendar. Not sure it will be available by launch but definitely something we plan to offer in time."
Really appreciating the regular updates since ordering. Worth the purchase price alone just for the insights into how products are conceived and produced.,3 months ago,Thanks; David; that's really nice to hear. We were hoping when launching the campaign that would be the case; so great to know that others also find this as interesting as we do! Hope all is well and thanks again for the support :)
In descending order; the following are my priorities in a phone:1. Talk2. Text; with the ability to group text; with responses going to the full group and not just to the sender. I also need to receive SMS and MMS texts and for text conversations to be threaded.3. Directions4. Automatic routing of calls from numbers not in contacts to voicemail (to avoid answering spam calls)5. Long battery charges6. Alarm clock with at least 4-5 alarms7. Calculator8. HotspotWill the LP2 do these?,3 months ago,"After trying both a Nokia 3310 3G and an ZTE Altair (also 3G); I found the text in both to be inadequate. The Nokia required T9 as it only has a numeric keypad and the ZTE didn't support group texts. Of course neither has directions or a hotspot. A calculator and hotspot are my least required features; but without them; I'll have to carry a second devise sometimes.

Hi Gregory; Thanks for sharing this. My notes regarding them: 1;2;3 yep. 4: haven't planned this exactly; but it's a good idea; we had something similar called ""filter"" in the original Light Phone and so this should be possible. 5. Will let everyone know what battery is looking like as we continue to test. The calculated estimate was at least 3 hours talk time and up to 14 days standby; so I imagine a few days of 'light' usage. 6. Currently there is only one alarm set at a time...

... but we can potentially change this. We did ask about it in our last survey and majority of people like the simplification of 1 alarm; but we do want this to be practical for our users and I don't think multiple alarms inherently is ""anti-light"".  Calculator and hotspot are both tools we plan to release; but at this moment I cannot 100% guarantee them by our initial launch although it is likely they might be available.

Sounds pretty good. 1-3 are the most important to me.  6-8 are the least important. The battery life you mentioned would be fantastic. Some way to avoid answering spam calls is nearly as important as directions to me. I hate spam calls; as does everyone else. If you all can come up with a better solution for that; you will have just invented the better mousetrap!Can't wait for shipping!"
I'd second the idea of being able to show the time when inactive. Maybe it's possible to update the display on a 5-minute interval without activating the radios so you can update the still image? I can't imagine that'd waste much battery if you can do it at a low enough level and not have to do a full wake up. Love the update and as excited as ever to get this in my hands! :),3 months ago,"We haven't given up on the idea; but it was certainly seeming more complicated than we initially imagined it would be. Thanks for chiming in though with that feedback! I agree that I don't think it should waste much battery in theory; and I'll ask for more specifics around that feature from our engineers as to what the hurdle was exactly. Hope all is well!

Sounds great Joe; thanks for being so responsive and receptive :)"
Great update and solid progress.  Form and scale look super.  Was always tending to black but white is looking lovely. I was just thinking about ringtone the other day and you are nailing the vibe.  Ready to bail on my smartphone and the timing is looking good!,3 months ago,Cheers; Brian! I've been full Light Phone II for the past two weeks; and although there have been some pretty big usability bugs that I hit along the way; I consider them minor inconveniences for how clear headed and free I'm feeling. Can't wait to get everyone their Light Phone II!
Hey - I just wanted to say that I loved the newest update. :) The sounds sound unique and special; and I really appreciate the continued work to achieve the original vision. Kudos and best of luck to you and your team through this!!,3 months ago,Thanks; Nathaniel!!
Hello; will the lightphone 2 work with sprint?,3 months ago,Sprint does not seem like it will be a good fit for the Light Phone in looking at the overlapping bands. We can try some testing but it was the one carrier in the US that we were hesitant to recommend on our campaign. If this means that you no longer are interested in the phone; I understand and we can certainly offer a refund if you email us (support@thelightphone.com). It may get some coverage; but we're not confident it would be a great experience on Sprint yet.
Don't normally comment on the internet -- this is an exception (ordered the Couples package)It would be very great to be able to use this phone as a mobile hotspot for when I am travelling and using my computer to do work (light phone + laptop work while traveling seems like total freedom imo ). Is this something that is possible?Also for what it's worth; I don't think any of the optional features; such as ride sharing; weather; etc; are necessary; and would detract; except for calculator.,3 months ago,Hi Patrick; This comment section is definitely the most I've also wrote on the internet; cheers. Hotspot is certainly something we are going to try; and we are planning to include it for launch as I think it was fairly simple since we already built out wifi functionality. My one concern at a high level is battery life drain while using hotspot if not plugged into the laptop for charging; but we will test that for sure. Appreciate the feedback!
Mannnn.Also: excited to hear the notification sounds/ringtones. Thanks for the peek.,3 months ago,Thanks; Jeffrey!
Ohh how come you wont have grey model anymore :( what changed? gonna be hard to decide between white and black. I wanted grey people would be disappointed :(. i looked at the update again closely its only white hmm. Also the feature should work in theory shouldnt drain battery if it not a constant thing and appear for few sec when the phone vibrate to tell you have notification alert pop in black screen. but software wise would be difficult since it hasnt been done on a inkscreen before,3 months ago,"Sorry for the confusion; it is still a grey version. It's the color of an e-ink lightest color which is not pure white. In theory I agree about 'sleep' function should not use much battery; but that's not how it would actually work according to our engineers. I can ask them for more specifics; I don't want to misspeak as to why it wasn't possible. Thanks for understanding.

I think you are likely right with the fact that it's not something that Android has built in function to control perhaps because we are using such a unique screen."
I love seeing these updates; and I especially love hearing that proto-ringtone! You're really nailing it; keep up the good work-Andy,3 months ago,Thanks Andy; that's been one of my personal favorite aspects to work on recently. Can't wait to share more of them. The one I chose to share is one of my favorites ideas so far... cheers!
Also one thing i been thinking about; on window phone 10 it has feature of glance (peek at time; notifcation etc at a glance) when the phone is off and pop up. Would jt work on ink screen?  or raise to wake feature? Overall love the update keen to seen more videos and updates,3 months ago,"From our last study with the manufacturing partner it seemed like we wouldn't be able from our OS to have the display do anything other than display a still image while the phone was asleep. We could have a ""pseudo sleep"" mode that might be able to achieve something like that; but it would also likely effect overall battery life unnecessarily; so for the time being when the phone is a sleep it will likely remain blank. Cheers!"
Nice to see the update; not much but still a update. nice to see improvement happening 70% done and loving the emoji look fabulous. Seeing the phone call in action is awesome nice and clear. would you be able to adjust volume between normal and speaker mode? love the alpha phone design. we got to see black; bit of white but no grey :( next update you should test texting in action and see how it perform in term of font size; speed texting and use of emoji etc.,3 months ago,Thanks Lorenzo. We definitely want tos how those action shots you mention; but felt it makes sense to show it in a more closer to final state. I had shot a walk through of the phone; but found that at each page I was pointing out was about to change/improve so we figured we'd hold off to next update for that. The light colored phone shown is grey actually; we've made really great progress there! There is only going to be two color models; really sorry for not making it clear in the update.
Looking forward to showing off the LP2. I've been promoting it to my circle of friends for some time now and just recently pulled the trigger on ordering one. Thanks!,3 months ago,Cheers!!
Still no update?,3 months ago,"Just posted; sorry it took so long; we've just been moving forward full speed. Appreciate your patience with us!

Yes I just watched - great news ?"
Hi Joe; me again... I was thinking about the software/management side of things; I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks; do you think it would be possible to have some kind of app that's managed online where you can add subscribed podcasts and then send the audio files onto the device? or is that kind of how you see the music function working?just concerned that there may be a lot of manual steps involved - again; not a deal breaker and looking forward to seeing how things have developed!,3 months ago,"Hi Bari; How's it going? It's certainly potentially possible to do eventually. We don't have a ton of details; but it seems fairly straightforward for us to have a way to wirelessly add ""music"" (any audio file; could be podcasts) to the device using the user dashboard and then have a simple interface for playing that. For it to automatically load and sync with a subscription would add to that complexity; but doesn't seem impossible from my less than technical view. Thanks and hope all is well!"
Will you consider keeping the USB-C input rather than USB-Micro? It strikesmethat it will be the device connector of (at least) the near future.,3 months ago,Hi Jonathan; Appreciate the feedback and I definitely don't disagree that it is certainly the more future proof and preferable connector. Unfortunately such a change at this stage in development is just not possible; it'd likely set us back at least 6 months; if we could even afford all of the cost of re-engineering/tooling etc. Thanks for understanding!
I initially preordered two Light Phone 2s for my wife and I but we have since decided after reading the updates that these phones are the perfect entry tech for our two young boys. This day in age of interconnectedness; children are often overlooked in design because of the stigma attached to traditional smartphone and tablet use among youngsters. These phones will afford my boys the simplest experience so as not to oversaturate thier life with distractions while giving me piece of mind.,3 months ago,We're heard similar reactions from other parents; and we think that's pretty cool; cheers Deven!
Will it be possible to tether the Light2 to my iPhone like the original light?,3 months ago,"Hi Daniel; Sorry for any confusion there; it's not as simple as we would like it to be (and that's our mission/goal to get to). The original Light Phone didn't actually ""tether""; which would likely use bluetooth and require the smartphone to be physically close and to be turned on. It used call forwarding/call masking to create that experience. For messaging however there is just no way AFAIK that exists to forward them to a separate device like the Light Phone II (carriers don't allow this)...

The Light Phone II will ship as an unlocked phone. Some users will swap their existing SIM into the Light Phone II to use as a secondary device from time to time; it would then get all incoming calls and sms messages. Other users will get a separate SIM and use it as their 'light number'; sharing w/ close friends and family. And there are users like myself that plan to use the Light Phone II as their primary device (I'm already two weeks in now!)... Please let me know if you have any questions!"
I second @Crystle Monahan's question: What is your business model for after the LP2 launches & How r u going to ensure viability from both an operational standpoint to satisfy users as well as fund your needs? Will there be some sort of UserVoice feature to better organize these requests into some sort of actionable agile feature request list.  I would hope ur business model isn't some sort of subscription based package 4 the intended/unlocked features. EG  u pay for Uber on a per month basis.,3 months ago,"I think we plan to operate as we have all along; balancing our transparency with our users and prospective users about our capacity for various features and why our phone costs what it does because of our customization; scale and ongoing desire to create free tools. While we never plan to charge for using tools; they are certainly not ""free"" to develop; but our business is in selling phones and we consider those an important aspect of our product and it is a part of our financial planning...

... We have taken on private investment through out our entire process; and have some really great investors that believe in what we are doing with Light for the right reasons (not just $ basically); and we will continue to take on investment that makes sense. We are also introducing the optional service plan to bring in some recurring revenue in addition to phone sales (which will also hopefully save some of our users some money while providing a better experience than dealing w/ carriers)...

...As for how we plan to efficiently collect user-feedback; we have some ideas but nothing final yet. I think the beta will teach us a lot in that regard. It's interesting to imagine using the phone for the feedback as a potentially option. My initial thought is that I'd personally rather share feedback from my computer/phone call where I can be more articulate than I am with texting; but we're still very open to ideas. We don't have to stop with surveys after the phones are shipped either...

Awesome! Thank you joe!"
Just wondering; once everything is ready for the public; like the phones themselves and the tools that are provided optionally; how will you continue to make money to fund tech support/tool development? I know you will still be selling phones; but will it suffice? I don't know a ton about business; but I'm a worry-wort and I don't want to see you guys have to close down. I'm also nosy I guess. Would there ever be a fee for tool usage? Or some other form of recurring income for you guys?,3 months ago,"Thanks for the question; totally makes sense; will try my best to answer. Our business model is predominately in selling the hardware and we have no intention to charge for future tools or usage (of course some tools like Lyft/Uber they would cost money in calling a ride; but we aren't taking a cut of that). We are planning to continue to sell phones ongoing to keep the ship sailing along as our main source of revenue. The optional service plan is a source of some recurring revenue too...

...We are of course the underdogs in many ways; and it can be scary/risky. It's been a rollercoaster of an experience of the past 4.5 years to keep the business alive. We really believe; however; that the the Light Phone II; although perhaps niche to the larger tech/phone landscape; has a serious place in the market for the many currently underserved users who want something different. If we let that fear paralyze us though; we might have never given the project a shot in the first place. Cheers

Thanks for the response! I really hope your company is successful for a long time."
I really hope the NA model doesn't use those bands listed below.  It'll be a paperweight.,3 months ago,My fault for incorrectly stating NA model and listing the bands for international model; sorry for the confusion. I have been using my 'alpha' Light Phone II exclusively (as my only phone) all around NYC and it has been getting very comparable service to my previous iPhone.
"Joe;Yesterday you commented ""FYI - The NA model uses bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28."" Did you mean the International model uses those bands? Your 2019 update lists those for the model B.",3 months ago,Thank you for the clarification; you are completely correct there; sorry for any confusion that may have caused. Here there are again for anyone curious: Bands (LTE FDD + VoLTE):     Model A: B2; B4; B12; B13; B17; B25; B26     Model B: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28
Hi Joe; I know you are planning on enabling the phone with your own mobile plan but are you still considering the phone being able to be supported on the Google Fiber network?,3 months ago,"Google Fi I meant to say; not Fiber

We would like the phone to be available on as many carriers as possible; including Google Fi. It's been hard for us to get a clear answer to date as to whether the phone would work with Google Fi or not. In theory the bands seem compatible; but they appear to have only a few phone certified by them for use on Google Fi; I'm not sure if they run some sort of app/software on the device? I'm sorry to not know more at this time.

Thanks Joe. I am using Google's service on a Pixel phone currently and yes; I believe you have to have their app installed (also called Google Fi) so that might be a roadblock. Happy to test though once the phone arrives."
Amped for it; Joe (and team).,3 months ago,
FYI - I know I mentioned to a few people that we were hoping to have an update out today; and it won't be ready until early next week. Thanks all!,3 months ago,
"The two best phones I ever carried were the original flip RAZR; and the BB9350Curve. The former had an easy to read large screen but the software neverreally matured. The latter was simply an amazing piece of tech; tiny light andextremely functional; days on a charge.  I'm old; crotchety and my eyessuck. Honestly a 100x60x10 form factor with a larger screen scaling the fonts up to the larger screen to make it easier to read would be tremendous.  You could call it the ""Light Fogey Phone"".",3 months ago,
Hey guys; I've been traveling a lot lately and have found myself to be really dependent on my smartphone for navigation - I'm not a NYC native and Google maps was super helpful for train routing. I'm curious about the navigation UX on the LP2. How fleshed out is the navigation UX concept at this stage and how do you guys plan to respond to modern navigation through the Light lens?,3 months ago,"Hi Parker; that makes sense. We're in the process of flushing out our tool roadmap in which there will be a good amount of exploration into directions/navigation as that is our most requested tool. At a minimum we imagine that the screen would display the next direction (i.e. turn left in 200 feet onto Metropolitan Ave) and that would live update as you move. Some details we have yet to figure out; but aspire to; include being able to set your mode (public transit / walking / bike or car?)...

...We don't have a lot of the details figured out yet and we want it to be as practical as it can for our users. Being able to see transit options is key to people living in cities IMO. It's also possible that the tool can continue to improve with time and feedback of course; so even if it's really 'light' initially we can work in some crucial features from working with our users.  Really looking forward to diving into the tools beginning next month... Cheers!

Sounds great Joe; thank you for the in-depth response and for your transparency!"
I'm excited! I was considering the original Light Phone but I wanted something that I could switch to more or less permanently (probably everything except for travel). Somehow I just became aware of the Light Phone 2; and it sounds like it will be everything I'd hoped for.,3 months ago,Cheers; Elliott! Glad our project crossed your path.
I am from the US but planning on traveling to Italy for a few months next fall. Will I be able to use my phone there?,3 months ago,Potentially yes; but each region/carrier uses different 4G antenna bands and you'd have to find a carrier that had a good amount overlapping with the North American model. Unfortunately we were unable to make a truly global model within our form factor without the antennas interfering and still pass certifications. FYI - The NA model uses bands: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28. There is a chance that the phone might have little or no connection however; thanks for understanding.
Is there any way I could get a non-working prototype for a talk I am doing on privacy and ditching smartphones which I have scheduled for May 1. I know you won't be shipping the actual working models by then; but I'd love to be able to pass around a mock-up of the device while I'm talking about it.,3 months ago,"Hi Gregory; I might be able to help you; no promises but shoot me an email to joe@thelightphone.com and I'll see what we have around that might work for your needs. Thanks for thinking of us of course!

Thanks. I have done so."
Hey Joe;  any word on a february / mid march update?,3 months ago,Goal is end of week this week; cheers!
Very excited for the phone; I check back frequently looking for updates. Can't wait to see the final product.,3 months ago,Thanks Jack!!
I would vote for returning to USB-C. Everyone one of my devices that has MicroUSB have had the cord or port break. Use the extra space that comes with USB-C to add a bit more battery life. Can't wait for the phone!,3 months ago,While I don't completely disagree with that logic at all; it is unfortunately too late at this stage for us to consider the swap. To make such a change without significantly impact the schedule; likely at least 6 months; and I'm not sure we even have the resources ($) to afford that many changes at this stage. Thanks for understanding!
hey just wondering; is there any chance if the messages can be replaced by the same massage apps that is free between light phone users?,3 months ago,
hey just wondering; is there any chance if the messages can be replaced by the same massage apps that is free between light phone users?,3 months ago,I'm not sure I'm following the question exactly; but I'll try! If you are asking about a light messaging platform that is over the internet and free; similar to how Whatsapp/Skype/Signal work; it's certainly an interesting idea; but being we're such a small team I think it'd probably make more sense for us to partner with an existing platform. Also if we built a platform you'd be limited to other Light Phone users; the unfortunate network effect that keeps many on Facebook and others. Cheers
In terms of navigation. I remember in days bygone driving a Mercedes that had a low graphic navi system. It basically showed an arrow with a distance in black and white. No actual map. When I heard you were thinking of adding navigation; that is what I had in mind. Not sure what is possible these days; but I think something like that should work with an E-Ink display.,3 months ago,"That's our initial hunch as well; and what we've been playing with in some UX studies. Cheers!

Super; There is Google Maps Go; though may still be to much for E-Ink.Sygic has a HUD option which could be adapted? Or other types of HUD apps that have a similar streamlined interface?Just an idea;"
HI there;Have been following you guys for a while and am really excited as have just placed order for two phones for me and my partner. Am sure you've answered this already; but could you let me know what; if any; navigation tools will be available for the Light Phone ii? Google maps? or just directions? Many thanks; and keep up the good work.,3 months ago,"Hi Paul; Thanks for the support and following along; we're super excited as well. Directions/maps has been probably the most universally requested ""additional tool"" so we do plan to prioritize it. At the moment we are not sure what the features will be exactly. Directions certainly seems possible; and we may be able to show some maps too; but maybe not a live navigation like one is used to with smartphones (e-ink screen not great for such live animations). We'll keep everyone posted with that!"
How are emoji being handled in texting? Also; I know it's come up before; but I just wanted to say it would be great to see a commitment to RCS support. At least in the future. Doesn't have to support 100% of it's features; but anything would be very much appreciated. :),3 months ago,"Oh; also; I use Google Play Music all the time; so if you're still looking into music services that could be included; that's a big one for me personally. I 100% expect them to do nothing with regards to official support; since they don't really even support their Android app; but there are multiple web based unofficial versions for different platforms. :)

Hi Andrew; Emoji support we imagine having options. You can have them come in as black & white emojis or you can disable them all together. Can you remind what RCS support means exactly? Sorry so many feature requests! Thanks for pointing out Google Play Music; although we may/may not be able to ever support an official tool for it; we will keep in mind for sure! We did ask about everyone's music platform preferences in one of the surveys too which was helpful. Cheers!

RCS is basically intended to replace SMS and MMS for basic texting. It has a lot of nice features like improved group chat support; read receipts; typing indicators; better file support; audio messaging; etc.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_ServicesAlso; it would be really nice to be able to view picture messages on the device; or at least be able to have the device download pictures/videos so they're able to be viewed when connected to a computer or something.

Hi Andrew; thanks for clarifying; I now see what you mean. In theory; our phone should be capable of making the transition just fine if SMS/MMS do really get retired. The phone is capable and does receive all of the images/videos sent to it; we've just started with our initial hunch which was we don't think users should be able to view them on the Light Phone II. That could change too. We asked about it in the last survey too to make sure we hadn't lost touch with the pulse of the backers.

I doubt SMS/MMS will be ""officially"" retired for a long time; but I think it's important to support the newer standard. It would be really disappointing to not be able to participate in a group chat with friends; or force them all to use the older standard; just because the device doesn't support it. Even if the device doesn't make use of all the new features.

My worry with pictures is that if the device isn't able to download and display them; any pictures from friends will be lost forever; or will require constant reminders for those friends to send those pictures to my email or another service; just so I can view them. This issue would be compounded in a group chat situation.I think at *least* having the device download the pics and making them available over USB or something would be helpful; but being able to see it on device would be best."
Any plans to include some IPX rating for water resistance ?I think this will good to have specially looking at use for purpose when you want to go light leaving your main phone behind,3 months ago,"sorry saw there is IPX3

Yep; we couldn't pull off complete waterproof unfortunately; which would have been great; but it is a somewhat water resistant. With the original Light Phone I sometimes used a generic little waterproof  pouch/wallet to hold my phone; ID and some cash for when i would take it to the beach or river."
Are you still on track for April first delivery for the earliest backers?,3 months ago,Hi George; I'm sorry for any confusion or if you were not receiving our regular updates via email. We had to shift our timelines; and won't be delivering phones in April. You can read more about it in the updates tab on the campaign. The earliest backers will receive their phones will begin in late June; but realistically most backers will receive their phone in the month of July. If you'd prefer a refund to waiting longer; please email us and we can help - support@thelightphone.com . Cheers!
When will we expect Feb & March updates and status on beta testing. also is the expected delivery April or july? On my contribution page its says April and you mention to a reply to a comment or previous update it was july?,3 months ago,Update expected for end of next week. It will cover beta timeline and plan as well. The phone will be shipping as early as late June; but realistically most backers will be getting their phones in July. There is no way for us to update the contribution page so I apologize for any confusion there. You can read about the timeline shift in our last update if you haven't already. Thanks for understanding!
Hi there; could you please assist me in providing instructions on how to get a refund for my campaign contribution?,3 months ago,Please email support@thelightphone.com; thanks
When can we expect another update?,3 months ago,Hopefully end of next week
hello Lightphone folks;  i'm delighted by your project and happy to support it!  since this comment forum seems to be the place to make feature requests; i'd like to encourage you to keep the headphone jack - please please please don't ever lose a physical; actual headphone jack as your design develops.  the bluetooth option is great; but i can't give up my IEMs or Beyerdynamic cans.  many thanks and keep on keeping on.,3 months ago,Thanks Ben! I can assure you that at this stage the physical headphone jack is here to stay for sure. Cheers
Hey Joe; just wanted to give a big thank you and some encouragement to you and the team on your dedication to this important project! Additionally; in response to your answer to the post 3 below me regarding phone support - since you have a small team; perhaps you could dedicate a few hours per teammate per day to do phone support. You could have a sign up for customers to choose a 30-45 minute time slot where they can get phone support. This way you can also give it a personal touch :),3 months ago,Hey Ben; Thanks as always for the support! That's a nice potential idea as we know we likely can't immediately have on the spot 24/7 available phone support; but if in emailing/chatting with a user that has more complicated technical challenge; scheduling a call with them to more efficiently help them than email would be nice.  We do plan to bring on at least two full time dedicated-support members closer to launch time; and we feel strongly that great support is something we value as brand.
Hey! No request or question here. Just a bit of encouragement to keep going. Youre creating a very good thing that will help lots of people (myself included) rid themselves of lots of distractions. Thanks! Excited for the next official update!,3 months ago,Seriously means a lot! We've been really grinding over here and that kind of encouragement goes a long way in keeping the spirits alive! Cheers and thank you. Hope to have the update by the end of next week.
Just curious as to why the switch from usb-c to micro USB?,4 months ago,It had to do with the internal size of the USB-C being too large to fit into the phone with making the phone longer. If that's a deal breaker for your needs we do understand and can offer a refund if you email us of course - support@thelightphone.com . Thanks for understanding!
Hi Joe; just jumped on board after months of watching this evolve. Thnx to the user happiness folks for answering questions so quickly during that time. Man; all the naysayers around me tethered to their devices pushed my decision way outta the box. That is way cool. Im not real techie.  Will there be some kind of support system to help navigate through set up and app installation? I only had a choice of black or white. Was there a grey phone? Thnx for making this happen. Peace to the LP2 team,4 months ago,Hi Cindy; Glad to have you on board! We want to have a lot of support materials to make understanding how to use the phone as simple as possible. It's a work in progress at the moment; but something we see as really important and aligned with our brand. We are exploring whether we will be able to offer some limited phone support for users that encounter technical difficulties; but we're a super small team still so that's TBD. As for color; every user will get to pick the color prior to shipping.
Waiting for March update.... :-),4 months ago,Cheers!
I apologize if this has been asked; but wondering about the possibility of a Calendar as tool?  Thanks.,4 months ago,Hi Christian; Calendar is definitely something we want to explore; especially from user survey feedback. It may be relatively limited functionality wise; perhaps only your next 1-3 events/meetings rather than a full fledge calendar app; but that is still TBD. We saw interest in calendar; but it is not our top priority at the moment. Thanks for understanding!
Hi Joe!I love what you're doing with the project! Wanted to ask about a few things:1. I've seen mentions of a case. Will a screen protector be available as well?2. I recall from an earlier update that there would be a comparison of the ghosting between colors? Is that still forthcoming?3. At this point in time; do you know the programming language for the SDK?Thanks much!,4 months ago,"Hi Shawn! Thank you :) 1. We have not yet considered a screen protector so it's not in our immediate plans; but it'd be worth seeing how many backers would like it as it might not be hard that hard for us to offer one. 2. Yep; we for sure plan to show many comparisons between the two color ways in the coming months. From my experience with black alpha phone; the ghosting is noticeable in extreme bright daylight; but much less so in normal indoor lighting. Still lots of optimization to come..

...3. As for language of the SDK; I believe it will use React Native."
Hey Joe; I apologise if I've missed this in an update; but is there a confirmed list of compatible carriers in the US? Thanks!,4 months ago,"Hey! It should work with pretty much any carrier in the US except Sprint (or MVNOs of Sprint). It may still work; but compatibility does not seem great with Sprint considering the antenna bands in the Light Phone II. Cheers

Beautiful; thank you. Have a great weekend!"
It's a 1st of March - any news? ?,4 months ago,
"I've pre-ordered a light phone 2. Now my wife wants one. Is it somehow possible to ""upgrade"" to the couples deal?",4 months ago,Hi Prescott! It's not super easy with the way Indiegogo platform works but if you shoot us an email to support@thelightphone.com we can assist in making that happen for sure! Sorry for the inconvenience!
Will the Light Phone 2 be able to connect to Dell Mobile Connect on my laptop to let me text from my laptop? Also; is there an update on talks with Spotify with getting that supported?,4 months ago,I'm not familiar with Dell Mobile Connect so I'm inclined to think it's not compatible; but I could be wrong about that. As for Spotify we haven't had much luck with our first few attempts. We were talking with the Mighty team (Spotify only shuffle-like device) and we learned a lot from them. We will need some cooperation from Spotify likely to make the tool function as we'd hope. It has not been a super priority at the moment though; so still pretty optimistic we can pull it off.
I just want to suggest that this LightPhone should have a very strong Wifi Hotspot feature. Fast; reliable and secure. It would fix many issues that people have; as they can just use another device (computer or tablet) to do all the things that a smartphone would do; but with a very low frequency of usage. Also; the ability to connect with my computer everywhere I go will be very valuable for me.And now that I am here... how about an eBook reader app? I mean; it has e-ink display... ?,4 months ago,"Hi John; we agree re: hotspot. If you absolutely need to do email on the run (say you get stranded at the airport or something even) you can open a device more suitable like a laptop with a bigger screen and keyboard for effectively doing email (or whatever it is you might need the internet for). Our only concern is how hotspot will drain the battery; but if you are plugged into a computer that shouldn't be an issue. For E-reader our concern is around small screen size; but it's possible we may.

Well I know that the screen is small; but you can easily adjust text size of an eBook. So even if you have to flip pages more often it would be a nice add on to read some books on the go. Just another device less that well have to carry! And yes please: Hotspot wile plugged in to USB would be even a better solution; you charge the phone and get to use your internet connection. Just make sure its ready to plug and go for Windows and MacOs and it will be perfect!"
Similar Docomo model https://buzzap.jp/news/20181017-card-ktai-docomo-2018-winter/,4 months ago,Yep; we've seen a few other backers share us the link when they were first announced. THanks for sharing!
I used to work on an open-source phone project called Openmoko. Since the dawn of that project in the 2009 era; I have been looking at a phone to port my middleware and UI concepts to. I'm looking forward to the Light Phone 2 as this may perhaps be the hardware platform I have looked for. Appreciating this project. Good speed! If you're still looking out for beta testers; btw.; send me a note.,4 months ago,Hi Michael; Sounds really cool! As for beta; we've had an overwhelming interest from our backers; and will be selecting lottery style as the slots are going to be fairly limited (I think ~100). If you did not get the survey link (new backers unfortunately don't automatically receive upon backing); shoot me a note - joe@thelightphone.com - and I'll forward you the link to sign up to potentially be a beta tester! Cheers
Sorry if this has been answered already; but will the white phone feature a 'night mode' that allows for the screen to go dark/inverted?,4 months ago,Sorry for not making that more clear. Yep! Either phone color has the option to invert the screen colors in the settings.
Question from the Netherlands: I joined the project from the beginning. Would it be realistic to expect the Light Phone somewhere in July/Aug 2019 ?Best Regards;Ben Verkolf,4 months ago,Yep; we are hoping to fulfill all our pledges by the end of July. Shipping will likely begin to backers in mid/late June. Thanks for the support; Ben!
Apologies for being a bit late to the game. I'm very excited nevertheless. If you still need Beta testers in Australia; I would love to volunteer. Otherwise; keep up the amazing work!!!,4 months ago,Hi Sarah! Thanks so much for the support. As for beta; we've had an overwhelming interest from our backers; and will be selecting lottery style as the slots are going to be fairly limited (I think ~100). If you did not get the survey link (new backers unfortunately don't automatically receive upon backing); shoot me a note - joe@thelightphone.com - and I'll forward you the link to sign up to potentially be a beta tester! Hope all is well :)
Why the move away from USB c? Was really a key feature for me.,4 months ago,I'm sorry for the disappointing news there; it came down to internal space required making the phone larger which we felt was a worse tradeoff for the Light Phone II. If this is a deal breaker; we do understand and will always offer full refunds; please email us at support@thelightphone.com . I hope that the switch away from USB-C isn't too annoying; thanks for understanding.
Congrats on $2.5M raised!,4 months ago,Oh wow! I hadn't even noticed we've been so busy working on/testing alpha phones. It's seriously so humbling to have such amazing supporters. We are all beyond excited to share the Light Phone II!
Hey there! Did you decide to go ahead with encrypted messaging apps like Signal? Haven't seen this specified anywhere. Thanks!,4 months ago,Hi Jenna; While we would love to explore that deeply and think encrypted messaging is aligned with Light Phone philosophy (I'm a big Signal fan myself); we have not found a way to implement it. We reached out to Signal founder and he was pretty clear about just how enormous of a task it would be to incorporate into our phone; so while we have not given up by any means; it's likely not going to be something we can offer by our initial launch. Thanks for understanding!
Tester in Poland/Europe ready! ?,4 months ago,
Hey guys; I am happy to support a phone in March if you are looking for a tester in Switzerland / Europe. cheers Tobias Mlhauser,4 months ago,
Nice mention in the Times today!https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/cell-phone-addiction.html?action=click&module=Editors%20Picks&pgtype=Homepage,4 months ago,Cheers thanks for sharing; Alice!
I think good feature would be 'do not disturb' when you connect you LP2 to the car audio. You can only answer or make a phone calls; no sms notifications - focus on the road not phone.,4 months ago,
Here's the latest Recode Decode podcast which I feel ties into the mission of Light and may be of interest to other contributors. Google and Facebook have become antithetical to democracy; says The Age of Surveillance Capitalism author Shoshana Zuboff https://goo.gl/H4dZPe,4 months ago,Thanks for sharing; my roommate actually sent it to me last night too; looking forward to giving it a listen!
Hi Joe and TeamAs a LightPhone2 User; I would like to open epub or mobi files in the phone; So that I could read an article; using the e-ink screen. Would something like this be possible? I was wondering if I could develop something like this myself and add it to the phone. Would it work? Thank you very much;Fer,4 months ago,"There is a chance we might make a tool for viewing documents as such; and we can certainly explore it; but our initial concern is around the small screen size being less than ideal for reading larger documents. When we develop the SDK for users to create custom apps; it should be totally possible to create something like this for yourself regardless. At the moment we do not have many concrete details about the SDK.

Thank you very much!"
For added passcode security; you could make it so that a certain number of attempts would lock the phone and force the user to reset via online portal which should require a more complicated alphanumeric password. Having my contacts and texts exposed doesn't concern me a great deal and I probably won't use a pin. I would like to be able to lock it remotely; get it's GPS coordinates and perhaps display lost and found contact info. Is the phone encrypted? Just thinking out loud. Cheers.,4 months ago,Thanks Bradley; those are some good ideas! It's true that what is at risk would be messages/contacts; but fortunately not payment info; photographs; email etc... and of course there is not tracking of third party apps. Multiple attempts lock is potentially really interesting as is locking remotely/lost info. The phone is not encrypted for messages I don't think but it's an admirable goal that I'd love to see offered if we can find a way to do so.
I noticed in a recent comment that you said there would be an option to use a 4-digit pin for security. Would you be willing to add the option of using more digits? Anything below six digits is not very secure anymore. I think this feature would fit into your mission of protection of users privacy.,4 months ago,"Or 6+ with the option for alphanumeric...Useful chart in linkhttp://fortune.com/2016/03/18/apple-fbi-iphone-passcode-hack/

It's a great point; certainly something I'd like to explore; thanks for sharing that link too. It was interesting to see average time of different PINs would take to hack by machine or human. We can likely add options for the passcode fairly easily in the settings; and I've made a note to understand what that would take with our software team."
Regarding notification is there sound and info on the screen till not readed or we must to push the button to see it?Notification and ringer sounds - did you prepare some sounds? are you able to give us a links to listen and even maybe vote which sounds we want on LP2? All the best,4 months ago,We talk about some of the notifications in the Oct/Nov update on Indiegogo; so I'd refer there to see how we plan to handle those with some examples of the screens. We are making custom sounds currently and the idea is that we'd have options for users to choose from as we realize everyone might have different preferences. Cheers!
Hope thanks to bluetooth LP2 connect with the car audio system (make/answer call; import contacts from the phone),4 months ago,That's the goal; I would also love that for myself as a user too. In theory it should be totally possible and fairly seamless experience with bluetooth and Light Phone II. Thanks!
Is there anyway to beg my way into being on of the testers? I am rather desperate to get away from these dreaded smart phones.,4 months ago,Appreciate the enthusiasm! We really do. We received an overwhelming amount of interest from our backers to be in the beta (cheers everyone) and we have a pretty limited number of slots. We can't promise anyone a spot because it just wouldn't be fair as much as I do wish I could share a Light Phone II asap! Thanks for understanding and hopefully you do get picked :)
Can you give us some idea as to the privacy features of the Light Phone 2? I am giving a talk on privacy in a few months and I would like to mention the Light Phone and Light Phone 2.,4 months ago,"Hi Gregory; Thanks for thinking of the Light Phone! To be honest there are not really unique privacy features to the Light Phone II aside from the fact that it just inherently doesn't have as much of your information as a smartphone and there are no third party apps (no  tracking from other platforms). Also there is no emails; payment info; photographs; etc. stored on the device; just your contacts and messages as a possible risk. There is an optional 4 digit PIN to lock the phone...

...If there were privacy features that you have in mind; we're certainly open to hearing them! Privacy is a value aligned with our phone and we'd love to push for more privacy features if possible. Cheers!

That is what I assumed and is; of course; a huge improvement in privacy by itself. I just wanted to make sure that there wasn't anything additional. I assume that if one has a talk and text only plan; with no data; that might further enhance the privacy of the Light Phone 2. That's exactly what I currently have with my Nokia 3310 3g."
What headsets will it work with?,4 months ago,"There is an audio jack; so any headset with an audio jack should work just fine. The phone also has bluetooth; so assuming the headset doesn't require a native app to connect; they should also be able to pair just fine.

Thanks! Will volume buttons on the headset work? I've had issues with third party headphone controls on other phones. Either way; minor concern. Very excited for the phone!

Haven't tested with bluetooth headphones (still use aux cord headphones myself); but I'm hoping that should be seamless. Will try to test that when we can."
Apologies if this has been asked before ; would it still be 4GLTE or any plans for 5G; I believe by the time phone comes out there will be 5G phones will be available in market with Networks available to support them,4 months ago,The Light Phone II is not going to have 5G. We did a lot of research into what bands we thought made the most sense; and we don't think 5G will be that readily available; even by the time we ship; for most of our users. 4G LTE seemed totally sufficient for the limited functionality of the Light Phone II. Hope that makes sense!
"One question about security - are you planning to add ""security code to unlock""?",4 months ago,"There is the option to set a 4 digit PIN for unlocking the phone currently.

Great! Thank you"
What about supported languages?,4 months ago,At the moment we can only guarantee English support. Ideally we're are hoping to be able to display a variety characters/languages on inbound messages for our initial launch; but we are not sure how difficult it will be to offer other language support for keyboards or the general OS yet. It is our goal/plan to offer more language support in due time. Thanks for understanding!
Tethering must have! then we can use it as a router for laptop ;o) Im really excited for the phone - all the best!,4 months ago,Cheers; tethering is certainly something we are planning to have as an optional tool. Thanks for the support and hope all is well :)
"First off; incredible design. I've used the same phone for 5 yrs waiting for one like thisIt seems like there are quite a few requests to ""please support/add x; y; z"". I know that you can't include all things people ask about. For the ones you end up with; is the plan to default to having them installed; or to make them an option that people install if they want? I worry if you keep adding things you get a monochromatic smartphone.I had the same question about updated battery life with 950mA",4 months ago,"Thank you!! The phone will ship with minimum phone functionality and all other 'tools' that we may offer would be optional to the user to add to their 'toolbox' (phone menu) or not. We would not want a user to have any unnecessary things on their phone and if we do introduce optional tools; we are going to be very intentional with how we go about designing them as to keep them 'light'...

As for the battery life estimation; I'm really hesitant to commit to numbers until we're testing on actual units in real world scenarios. Just from speculation (our engineers calculations; not actual testing) the phone could last a little over two weeks on standby and would have at least two hours of talk time. Talk time as far I understand it will vary depending on circumstances like signal quality. Hoping that real world 'light' usage with messages and a few calls should last a few days."
Definitely vote for a calculator and if possible tethering.   That way I can replace my iphone completely,4 months ago,Appreciate the feedback! Both of those suggestions are reasonable tools that we plan to develop for the Light Phone.
How long to you think the phone battery will last.  E.g. on standby / phone calls.  I couldn't find any data from my search.  Also once you have production ready samples will you post images as I'm torn between black and white!,4 months ago,"Hi Daniel; We will certainly be sharing lots of images/videos of the final units to make the color decision easier for everyone; although I'm personally torn between which one I want to use. As for battery life; I'm pasting my response from a few minutes ago with another comment; cheers!...

A few things Id like to requestBird/Lime in the ridesharing section.Simple Calendar/Reminder Support. Something as simple as your next event is in 10 minutes on the home screen with GCal.Spotify is what I hope you mean by playlists; I dont own mp3s much at all anymore.Also; there are these devices called Tiles that keep you from loosing things and they need a tethered phone. Also Fitbit. But I suppose theres always some extra thing that could use a real android phone for emergencies.,4 months ago,Thanks for the feedback Ryan! Simple calendar support is something we've heard from a lot of users so we will certainly explore that. Ridesharing/playlist tools we'd like to have a variety of options ideally as everyone has different preferences. Spotify would be great for many; but it will also require some support from their team to make it work with Light Phone II. We've started those conversations and are hoping for the best; but it is a little out of our control in some ways. Cheers!
Hi; I'm really excited for the phone! I could have missed it but I was just wondering if the backlight on the screen will illuminate the entire surface of the phone to continue the seamless feeling. Thanks!,4 months ago,"Hi Sean; It uses a front light actually; it's a piece of glass that sits on top of the E-ink display and has LEDs on its side that illuminate through the glass. It sits underneath the top glass with paint and will only illuminate the active display area. It would not be possible to light up the whole front glass (the LEDs themselves would also be exposed). It only uses the light in low light situations so to me it hasn't felt ""wrong"" when I've held it in my hand. Hope that makes sense!

Makes sense. Thanks Joe!"
I saw below that the Light Phone II does not pair with a smartphone; which surprised me. Wasn't that the idea behind the original Light Phone?  Do you expect most users will use Light Phone II as a replacement for their iPhone/smartphone? Or as a supplementary; second phone?,4 months ago,"Hi Will; That is correct that the original Light Phone was only intended as a secondary phone. We were able to call forward/call mask to make a more seamless experience between the two technically unique phones (different SIMS). That process was never quite as seamless as we'd hoped; partially due to iOS restrictions and partially due to carrier restrictions. With the Light Phone II however; there is no way to forward messages or mask outgoing messages. Carriers however have started to...

come out with two phones; same number services like the one we created for the original Light Phone. As a carrier they are able to forward messages between two devices in a way that we as users or Light company can not. We are trying to make sure the Light Phone will be compatible with such services wherever possible. In general from our surveys about 60% of our users plan to use the phone as a replacement/primary device (including as a childs first phone)

Other expressed wanting to eventually make that transition upon trying the Light Phone in hand. Using it is as secondary device; were letting the users decide how theyd like to fit it into their lifestyle (its essentially an unlocked phone). Some prefer swapping SIMs between two phones (no additional plan needed); some we learned actually prefer having a dedicated light number. You can still forward calls; but messaging created an impossible hurdle for us to offer a universal solution.

Hope that makes sense!"
Hi;It's not written explicitly so I would like to ask if the phone is going to support tethering. In other words can I use it as WifiHotspot? txs!,4 months ago,Hi Vito; That is our goal to have as an optional tool by launch and it is very likely; but we have not 100% confirmed it yet explicitly as we want to be able to test it on an actual device and ensure that it works acceptably before confirming. Thanks for understanding!
Hello!Not to pester you; I'm just so excited about the phone and curious about the process. Have you begun the Alpha Testing yet? How is it going?,4 months ago,Hi Sarah; All good! We're excited too :) Yep; we have begun. We're basically in the process of testing one aspect at time and thus far have successfully proven that it can send and receive texts; answer a call; place a call; turn on speaker phone and mute... We're releasing versions every other day and then testing the new functionality; it's starting to feel real! The design itself still needs finessing and we are working to optimize the E-ink driver for quicker refreshes and partial refreshes.
Hey Joe; loved hearing about the SDK and the possibility to load tools with zero fluff! No more of that OCD I get when staring at those icons I never use. Question; as a developer; I wonder if there's any talk around the watercooler related to open source tool development? For example; I'd love to have Signal on the phone; but read here that the development is a bit daunting; so maybe it's something the Light community could lend a hand with ;) Thanks!,4 months ago,Hi Dieter; Thanks! The SDK is an exciting idea; but to be honest we do not yet have the many details at the moment. That being said; we're also quite big fans of Signal and approached their team right after the campaign ended. They had a similar reaction that it would be a daunting endeavor and probably require a dedicated engineering team bigger than our current team all together. We certainly aren't giving up on the idea by any means; just wanted you to know it's on our minds as well.
Hey Joe;Is it possible to get a refund? I love what you guys are doing; but need the money at the moment. Thanks,4 months ago,Yep; totally understand; please email support@thelightphone.com and we will help you take care of that. Thanks again for supporting our project and hope our paths cross again one day!
Quick Question;Will one be able to view text messages while in middle of a call?This becomes an issue when you are being sent a security pin or the like.,4 months ago,"Thanks for the great question. I think our current thoughts were to not allow the user to navigate away while on a call. In theory we could try to find a solution to keep the call active perhaps with a banner along the top like in iOS to be used as such; but we'd want to really think about it. Multitasking is something we didn't want to encourage. I'm not sure I've ever encountered needing a PIN while on a phone call itself; but I can see how that would be annoying if you were in that situation

I run into this issue when calling banks & the like. It could only be when I forget a password. Basically as a security measure I have been asked to read back a PIN that was just messaged to me; to confirm my identity.

I appreciate you bringing that to our attention; we'll think hard about how we can hopefully find a suitable solution as there are certainly other instances that a PIN as well that a user might want to jump out of the phone to check a message like maybe to double check an address or details of an event etc."
Just a quick thought I had that I would like to share.... I was looking at this photo: (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/548e1556e4b062b18d62e460/t/5c4f1af403ce647adb3b36d5/1548688120173/PackagingMockup.gif?format=2500w)and noticed that the background image goes well with the white phone; but not so much with the black phone (due to how much white is in the image). Perhaps an image of a starry night (or something along those lines) would be more suitable. Again just a thought. Cheers!,4 months ago,"But not too dark; so that there will still be some contrast between the background image and the phone itself. Again; just a thought I had. If this is helpful in some way; awesome! If not; that's cool too.

It's a great idea; and certainly something worth exploring; thanks for sharing that feedback. That photograph is not 100% the one we are going forward with; but was just a way to share a direction we were excited about. I do think it's cool that each model would have their unique packaging details. Cheers!"
I'm disappointment when heard the back casing is not aluminium and use Micro USB not USB-C.,4 months ago,I understand; and I also as a future Light Phone II user myself; wish that it were still USB-C and aluminium; however it was just possible for us to achieve that. If you are no longer interested in the Light Phone II because of this we also understand and can offer a full refund if you email us at support@thelightphone.com . Thanks for understanding.
I am looking forward to it! It is a little question.For example; pair with iphone and receive an incoming iphone with this. Do you think that?,4 months ago,"For the Light Phone II to receive calls from an existing phone a user would need to manually forward their calls to the Light Phone II's phone number from that existing phone or swap the SIM from the existing phone into the Light Phone II (assuming it's compatible). The Light Phone II does not actually ""pair"" with a smartphone; sorry for any confusion there and hope that makes sense."
I know that there is a charger included with the order; but if a charger is lost; or you just want to have 2; will there be a way to order another one later on?,4 months ago,Hi Daniel; The phone will ship with a custom USB cable and we will have more available incase a user wants extra and/or loses them. Any MicroUSB charger will work with the phone; our cable is just color matched and the port base is the exact depth of our phone so it feels like a nice match when connected. Hope that makes sense!
Hello;Was just thinking that a useful tool would be: Do Not Disturb; with the option of allowing your contacts to pass through the filter to reach you. Robo calls are the worst.,4 months ago,"Great idea; we had a similar filter feature on the original Light Phone (only your contacts would ring through). I don't think we can use the term ""do not disturb"" as I believe that's probably an Apple trademark; but I certainly would also love a feature like that. We think having control over notifications is very aligned with the idea of the Light Phone. There is already a way to set different settings for calls and messages and physical buttons to easily turn off all notifications. Cheers!"
Hi Joe; Someone in the comments did mention this but would like to highlight again since it made me thinking. I ordered the white version as well so how is it going to handle dirt and finer prints. Unfortunately i had a similar experience in the first Jolla phone where the half (other half) went off white in the first two months of use. Will it have like a special coating? I really love the combination of white and black so dont wish to change the phone color. But any solution is a great help.,4 months ago,Hi Ali; It's a great point. I'm not sure the names of the coatings used; but I'm pretty sure there are more than even one special coating. I don't think dirt or finger prints will be an issue on the casing. The haze in the matte glass also helps makes finger prints much less noticeable than on a smartphone screen which is cool. There are a series of test called accelerated life tests which we will be running with the device to ensure it can withstand normal wear. Cheers!
Hi; I backed this project a month or so ago for one Light Phone 2 (contributing $335); and have now shown to my daughter who thinks it's a great idea - I was thinking of getting one for her two and was wondering if it would be possible to somehow join my past contribution with another one to get the couples deal?She also wanted to know about the ride home feature; if this was still a plan to include this and if this would work in the UK; where we are based? Looking great; thanks!,4 months ago,Hi Andrea; Unfortunately there are not super convenient ways using the platform to swap the perk; but if you email us at support@thelightphone.com I'm sure we can find a solution for you! We are certainly still exploring it and it seems very possible from our initial studies; but compatibility in UK would depend which services (Uber / Lyft / etc.) we can offer and when. I don't have a concrete answer for that yet; thanks for understanding!
Is Bluetooth compatibility in general a goal for the light phone 2?,4 months ago,Indeed it is. There is bluetooth in the Light Phone II; and we hope to make compatibility as seamless for as possible for working with other devices. I'm sure there may be outlier cases where a device requires a native smartphone app for pairing that may be problematic on the Light Phone? But in general we're hoping it should be fairly straightforward and easy. Cheers!
We are super excited about the Light Phone! Could you please verify if the phone will be able to navigate and relay directions when driving? Will it be able to link via bluetooth to cars and give directions through the audio system of the car? I thought I had read this was the case in a previous update; but can't find the info. Thank you!,4 months ago,Hi Carolyn; Thanks for kind words and support! At this time; directions and navigation are still a goal of ours but I am unable to confirm that it will be able to navigate and relay directions when driving until we have fully tested that it is possible (that it works well enough to be used). It is likely possible; I just don't want to over promise. There is bluetooth and so it should be able to sync with the audio system no problem. It's certainly our goal and something I would use myself too.
I'm sorry Joe; I'm bowing out. Could you please send me the information for refunds?,4 months ago,No need to apologize Colby; appreciate you spending time with our project regardless. For anyone interested in a refund; please email us at support@thelightphone.com ; thanks for understanding and hope our paths cross again!
Hi Joe; would you be sure to let us know when you know for sure whether there will be a music-playing feature on this? That is essential for me since I have ADHD (hence I want to quit my iPhone) and listening to music is necessary for me to be able to focus without medication. Thanks!,4 months ago,Hi Joseph; We do plan to be quick to let everyone know our progress (or not) with various tools. At a high level; we always planned to have a music playlist for users to use their own music; and that will likely be possible; but I am a little concerned about other platforms (like a Spotify tool for example) because we will need their cooperation and support to make it work and that is out of our control. Hopefully we can pull it off! We have begun such conversations with Spotify already.
Hi Joe - many thanks as always for your thoughtful response to all the comments! I had a thought regarding cases - I'd love to see a version with a slit on the back that could fit my contactless credit card - it would mean I could instantly turn my Light Phone II into a payment device! Cheers.,4 months ago,Hey Roy; That's an interesting suggestion; especially because I know a few users asked about NFC chip possibility. We knew it was not our expertise to solve for wireless payments ourselves; but maybe this kind of solution could work for some users. No guarantees that we will have such a case; but certainly taking note of the idea and really appreciate you taking the time to share that with us. I'm not personally familiar with using contactless cards; but am starting to see it more and more.
Hi Joe - many thanks as always for your thoughtful response to all the comments! I had a thought regarding cases - I'd love to see a version with a slit on the back that could fit my contactless credit card - it would mean I could instantly turn my Light Phone II into a payment device! Cheers.,4 months ago,
Brett McKay from the Art of Manliness gave a solid shout-out to the Light Phone I and Light Phone II. It was during the most recent podcast interview with psychologist Cal Newport on his new book Becoming a Digital Minimalist. You can find the shout-out within the last 15 minutes or so of the podcast if you are interested. I'll include a link for those who are:https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/digital-minimalism-cal-newport/,4 months ago,Awesome; I had no idea thanks for sharing! I'll certainly take a listen. I did read an article about Cal Newports book though! Cheers Adam
Im impressed by the amount of thought going into all aspects of the product. I know youre testing paint colors; but how will the white phone handle dirt; finger grease; pocket lint; etc?,4 months ago,Hi Ken; I'm not sure the exact names of the coatings that we'll be using; but the paint will be fairly protected from normal handlings. There are these accelerated life tests that are pretty cool where they will simulate long term use. One is the purse test in which they have a purse like bag that they put the phone and normal objects like keys; coins; lipstick; etc. and shake it pretty viciously for extended periods of time to see how it holds up. Hope that was able to answer your question!
Hi light team; couldnt be more excited for the light phone II! Its been mentioned in some of the updates I believe that there would be a opportunity to change color from the initial order; do you know when that would be?  Color matching with the screen is very important to me so Id probably like to switch to the grey if thats the most accurate with the bezel and screen itself.,4 months ago,Hi Jack; We're going to confirm everyone's color; model (region) and shipping address probably about 6 weeks prior to shipping. We want to have lots of videos/photos of each color to make that decision even easier. Between the screen and glass paint; black is likely to be the closest match because the shadow blends in more; but we'll have lots of examples for sure. Thanks!
Hey guys; this is something I really just thought about regarding the user interface. Is there touchscreen capability or is the navigation purely through the side/top buttons? It's not a huge grievance on my part; honestly; if there isn't a touch-capability - I just realized that I don't exactly remember coming across any mention of it.,4 months ago,Sorry for not making that more clear! Yes; there is a touch screen. Cheers
HI; I ordered two light phone with two accounts; my old account and new one.I really need to change the address for my old account but I cannot access. Hope you help to change email for my product. ('garinkim7@gmail.com' is new emailand 'gracekim8282@gmail.com' is old one.)thanks,4 months ago,Hi Garin; Sorry Indiegogo makes this less than convenient. I'm going to pass this information along to our support team and we'll email your new email to confirm everything. We won't be able to update the email to your Indiegogo backing unfortunately; but we will certainly update our records and make sure we reach out to the correct email to confirm shipping address/color preference etc this spring. Thanks for understanding and hope all is well!
Hello I'm really excited to see this project come to fruition. I was wondering about the ability to change the input language.,4 months ago,"Thanks for your excitement and support! At the moment we can only promise English language support; but we're interested in supporting other languages as soon as we possibly can; we're just a small team right now and trying to be realistic about our development capacity. Thanks for understanding!

I totally get thanks for the info; and good luck !"
Hey! I love the updates- again thanks for  the transparency.So how will group text messaging work?  Will there be issues with being included in smartphone (iphone; android; etc) group messages?  Just making sure it isn't a bunch of single chains instead of one group thread.,4 months ago,Thanks for the kind words; Casey. Group messages will be handled in a thread; as one might expect it to be handled from a smartphone. iMessage can't be support outside Apple devices; so a group with iPhone users would handle similar to having an Android smartphone would (green speech bubbles). Hope that was able to answer your question.
Do you have an idea of how long the battery life is roughly going to be with a full charge and average use?,4 months ago,It's hard to say until we're using the device in context; and average use is hard to define as this device is hopefully going to be used much less frequently than a smartphone would; but I would think it should last at least a few days with normal light use. Purely standby (on listening for incoming calls; but not using it) one calculation I saw estimated over 13 days. For a long phone call I believe the last estimate was a few hours talk time. Definitely looking forward to testing this!
"I'm very excited to have finally pulled the trigger on supporting this campaign after months of following the updates! I'm soooo happy you plan to release an SDK for us to build our own ""tools""- offsets any worries I might have had about the limited features of the phone. I know details about the SDK are a ways off; but I was wondering if you had given any thought to how user-created tools could be shared with others? Making this as easy as possible could do wonders for building a real community",4 months ago,"Hi Kyle; love the enthusiasm; thanks for joining the project! To the latter point about sharing custom tools; we don't yet know; but are also curious and interested in finding a solution for that because we agree that could be really amazing.

Ya I figured it was too early; but glad to hear you're looking into solutions!! I know it's not perfectly in line with the philosophy of the phone; but I really wanna make a tamagotchi-esque virtual pet for my future Light Phone! :P

one that's less annoying though; for sure"
Do we know how the handle will manage MMS and SMS messaging? If I receive a group message; how will it appear?,4 months ago,Hi Daniel; Group messaging will be handled in a thread; similar to how you might expect them to be handled on a smartphone. Images/videos/etc. will not be viewable; however it will still be indicated to you that media was sent with an icon.
Has the lifespan of this phone been taken into consideration in its design? What steps have been taken to ensure that one phone could potentially last ten or fifteen years?,4 months ago,Great question! To be honest there have not been many steps taken to ensure the phone could potentially last ten or fifteen years. It's a very admirable goal and something I wish we had tangible answers for you; but it is not something we've yet been able to tackle ourselves with either Light Phone. Thanks for understanding.
Hi; sorry to post again so soon; but I'm thinking about making a diy phone case from a notebook; but need to have a better idea of the dimensions. I'm most curious about the depth of the phone; so I can ensure I get a thick enough notebook. If nothing else; I can wait for the phone to be released; but I might as well ask. Thanks!,4 months ago,"Hey; that sounds cool! The final dimensions of the Light Phone II are 95.85mm long x 55.85mm wide x 8.75mm deep. Hope that helps!

It does help! Thanks :D turns out I already have a perfect sized notebook I can turn into a case. Thanks again!"
I promised myself I would like to keep questions to a minimum; but I would like to know about the repairability of the product. For example; Microsoft released the Surface Pro 3 with almost zero regard to repairability. iFixIt ended up having to give the Surface Pro 3 a repairability rating of 1/10 since it was almost impossible to repair.,5 months ago,"I suppose I'm one of the few people who do not like the thought of throwing away a product when it breaks and will see what they can do to repair it if possible. If necessary; would replacement parts be readily and easily accessible; and would ease of repairability be somewhat reasonable? In an era of planned obsolesence; (although I do not believe you are planning on obsolesence) I like to do what I can to own a maintainable and repairable product.

Also; what is Lightphone's stance in regards to how it will handle conference calls and call merging?

Hi Aaron; Great question. Unfortunately I don't have a great answer as the Light Phone would not score high on user repairability. I believe a lot of that has to do with trying to squeeze our mostly customized parts into such a small factor; but sadly the design of the Light Phone II is not very user repairable. Conference calls and merging we've done some testing with functionality but have not flushed out the interface design and final experience yet. Curious how would you like those handled?"
Hi; not sure if this has been brought up before; but what will happen as far as protecting the phone beyond a case? Is there going to be some sort of warranty or protection plan offered? What would it cover; how long would it last; and how much would it cost? Just wondering.,5 months ago,Hi Crystle; Great question. We have do not have a finalized written warranty yet; but in general we want to be really fair to our early supporters and backers. Obviously for any defective phones we'd replace them free of charge. In the past with the original Light Phone we offered discounted replacements (at our cost essentially) for users who accidentally broke/lost a phone and we'd likely offer something similar for Light Phone II. We will have a final warranty before shipping that we'll share
Really digging the perforated manual in the packaging.,5 months ago,Cheers!
No worries with the delay and super excited about the phone. Two questions: how can one be a beta tester and will Apple Music be supported?Thanks!,5 months ago,"Hi Karim; Thanks for the kind words and support. My guess is that it is unlikely that Apple Music would be possible on any non-Apple device; but I have not explored it deeply yet.

Hi Joe; thanks for the reply. Apple Music can be used on an Android device. So it would great to have that if possible. Thanks for creating a great phone!"
You may want to update the changes on the main page to mention that the phone is no longer aluminum. I was excited to learn more about your work with Armando in the last update. Was there not enough room for that?,5 months ago,Good point re:aluminum! Will update that now; thanks. We did run out of characters in the update as we usually do; but that's not the reason we didn't share about that yet; it kind of just got pushed lower priority to the other timeline/hardware updates. Great feedback though; I'll include something in the next update for sure!
Would love to be part of a feedback/usertest team. Is there a possibility to subscribe to a users feedback group?,5 months ago,I think something like that sounds like a great idea. Right now we've been sticking to this Indiegogo comments section; but upon launching and sharing the phone with everyone I think it makes sense to have an internal group board for users to share ideas in a more suitable format (the comment section here not ideal for collaboration/brainstorming). Thanks for sharing that suggestion!
Hello;I have a few questions regarding privacy and security regarding the LightPhone and its LightOS:Privacy protection how is it?Trackers are they disabled? Can somebody track the phone?Do You have layered security protection? Does the communication have any decentralization? Asking all of this because of the countless times both iOS and Android users have been compromised and their metadata being saved and sold to others.,5 months ago,The Light Phone II; being that it does not have any apps or internet browser inherently does not share information with third parties. There is a GPS; turned off by default; but a requirement of the FCC for emergency phone call situations I believe. You can set a passcode for the phone itself. The phones uses standard SMS texting and 4G voice calls; there is not encrypted messaging yet although that would be a nice future feature. Hope that was able to help!
Thanks for the update!  We are excited that things are progressing!   Are there any plans for a custom case for protecting this beautiful device?,5 months ago,We do plan to at least have one case (two colors for the two models) available by the time we launch; that can be added to your phone pledge and arrive with the phone. We have just started those explorations and don't have many details now; but we're thinking a simple silicone case perhaps.
Hey Everyone;I just wanted to shoot this over ur way as a nice reminder of why we backed this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUMa0QkPznsJoe & Kai  I hope you know there are people out there who stand behind you & appreciate what is that you're tying to accomplish. ur LP1 journey was amazing & had me excited at every turn. I'm confident that u two will deliver a game changing product & I hope too many people aren't discouraged in the SMALL delay. Carry on & keep up the great work!,5 months ago,Thanks Richard for sharing that video! I had not seen it; but it certainly resonates. Appreciate the kind words and encouragement; very blessed to have such amazing backers!
Ive appreciated the aesthetic taste around this product  the video; mockups; UX explanations; so Im happy those values are informing production decisions; too.Question: Will the over-the-air updates work over WiFi; or do we need to have data enabled on our Light Phone?(Ive switched to a dumbphone and discontinued data on my account - not that its much cheaper; since Im in Canada; where plans are hugely overpriced. I wish your simple; all-you-can-eat plan could be available here.),5 months ago,"Alistair; Any of the over-the-air updates can happen over Wifi. I do hope we can expand our plans beyond the US; and when we do Canada would likely be one of the next places we explore.

Great; thank you!"
Hey Joe; 2 dumb questions haha. 1: When the phone is off will the screen be white on the black phone? 2: Will there be backlighting for viewing in the dark? Stoked for our Light Phones :-),5 months ago,Hi Cory; It's a great question and one of the reasons we chose an E-ink screen is that the screen color when off will match the color of the phone itself. On traditional screens it would always be black when off; so that the light gray phone would have a big black box. Yep; it's technically a front light though (a piece of glass that sits on top of the E-ink screen with lights situated on the side reflecting across the glass illuminating the screen).
Question.. I see that we will be able to make our own tools/apps. Is it going to be consumer friendly for non coders like myself or too advanced for only developers?,5 months ago,We do hope to have an SDK (Software developer kit) and we will try to keep it simple; but it will likely require a pretty decent amount of coding experience.
Dear Joe;Guess I missed the survey email. Can you please share the link here? Thanks! The new update looks so promising that i almost skipped a beat looking at the initial mockups. Cant wait to get my hands on such a unique masterpiece.,5 months ago,Hi Ali; I'll email you the link as we are trying to keep it exclusive to backers; thanks for understanding!
"I totally get all the comments about ""please keep it as simple as possible"" and the ethos of wanting to go light.  That is why I think the importance of users being able to program their own tools is so important.  This way you can make the phone as minimalist as possible but end users can build the ""one"" app that they need which would allow them to ""go light"" in their own best way.  We all want the minimum that we need to leave our smartphones behind; but everyone has a different minimum.",5 months ago,It's true; I do think everyone wants a more simple phone and that's why we are all here; but it's been interesting to see how different everyone's core needs are. We would like to be flexible and makes this a usable phone that allows us to ditch smartphones more than less. I think that's why an SDK so that users can customize the phone if they feel they need to is a nice option to have. Thanks again for the support and hope all is well!
"On the assumption that we'll be able to sideload apps with metadata such that they will appear in the main menu as ""tools""  is there currently a recommendation of framework/tooling to use? A while ago it was suggested that some React Native templates may be provided later; is that still the right track? i.e. if I write an app for my bank following what Light design principles I have so far seen in React Native; will I be well placed to drop in the templates/styles when/if they become available?",5 months ago,Hi Stephen; When we are able to release an SDK for custom apps that is how we imagine it would work with being able to add them to your toolbox as well as some sort of style guide/templates. At this point we have not dove into this further with the engineers as through April they are focused on getting the core OS built solid; just a reminder. Cheers!
Also; when you send out the phones; I'm going to need to change my address. Moving to a new state in June and don't know what the address will be just yet.,5 months ago,Yep not a problem. I should have made this more clear; but have been planning to follow up with every backer prior to shipping to confirm address; color preferences and model (region).
"I noticed that the perk number has changed for people who have ""claimed"" a phone or two.  I claimed a couples pack a couple months ago. Is it still good or do I have to do it again? I don't want to have to buy it twice.",5 months ago,"Sorry for any confusion. I wanted to update the expected shipping on the perks so it wasn't deceiving for new backers. Unfortunately I was unable to edit the date to the existing perk so duplicated them and the counter reset. Everyone's pledges are still there!

Okay; thank you!"
Nice update -- like some others have said; I don't mind the delay if it means a more refined design. Thanks!,5 months ago,Cheers; Alex!
"I don't mind about the wait. Make the phone the best you can make it. I'm sure you guys are gonna do great! Keep up the good work! Thanks for taking the ""haze"" percentage into consideration. I'm excited about the final product!",5 months ago,Thanks Noel! Appreciate it
Thank you for all the updates and answering questions; it is appreciated. Question: will email eventually be a tool? I dont want it; but I need it for work...,5 months ago,"Hi Adam! We don't have any plans for email as a tool I don't think. That being said; I did a test with IFTTT (https://ifttt.com) and I was able to forward things from my email to myself as sms. My test was that every time Kaiwei sent me an email it would auto-text me the subject of the email only and I could decide if it was urgent to jump on a computer and check. I likely won't use this myself honestly; but perhaps there is a workaround that might help you achieve what you need with sms?

Hi Joe; thank you for your reply. Sorry if Im stretching keeping it light but Im trying to figure out how best to use this phone and still have email access on the go; where I cant jump on a computer...For those that need the whole email on the go; what is the best solution? If I have an iPhone *shudder* can I switch the SIM cards and use either phone? I love what you are creating!"
Ive never been so happy about a delay in my life.  Excellent choice.  Sounds like were going straight ahead here.  Fantastic.   Great work by a great team.  One last thing...please...please keep this wonderful idea as simple as possible.  Thanks again.  ,5 months ago,Thanks Drew; sincerely appreciate the kind words! Simple is the goal for sure :)
Good move on glass; even though it causes a delay. The glass is key to this being very; very useful; or just an interesting new toy. Also; please do continue your plan for some firm of green packaging. The World thanks you!Keep up the great development work; and thanks for the quality product updates.Dave,5 months ago,Thanks David for very encouraging words. I'm feeling good about our decision too and eager to make this the best phone we possibly can.
"Thanks for letting us know about the further hardware developments! Still as excited as ever for the final product; appreciating the hard work that's going into design.Was wondering: have you seen the E-ink displays dying/wearing quicker in the black models vs the white models? In other words; is there a marked difference in screen life when the negative space is ""inked"" vs the positive space being inked?Thank you - best of luck in these next few months!!",5 months ago,"Hi Nathaniel; Thanks for the kind words! I'm feeling more excited as I can really see it coming together closer to what we originally imagined and knowing that we crossed some of the most potentially detrimental technical milestones with software. In my use I have not been able to notice a difference in battery life; but it'd be worth doing a side by side test once they're ready. I don't believe there is an energy consumption difference between the two; but would be good to know. Thanks!

Joe - thanks for the response!! That is super exciting; and per the newest update; I'm glad you guys are fighting for that original vision. We're behind you. Cheers!"
I appreciate the update!  I'm all for pushing back production if it results in a better product.  I wasn't a backer of the Light phone 1 but I think I read somewhere that that one was delayed as well? I expected this; honestly.I've got my fingers crossed that I score a beta phone...I can't get rid of my POS smartphone soon enough.  I've been on grayscale for about 6 months and I still catch myself killing time.  It's like trying to quit smoking while always having a pack on you!,5 months ago,"Anyways; keep up the good work Joe & Team!  Know that once people start to see this phone in person it'll become a smash hit.

Hi Bear; So nice to hear that you understand about the delay; much appreciated. It's true that the original phone was delayed; and honestly after going through that stress of conveying delays to backers we really thought hard about when we realistically thought we could deliver in promising April so we would never have to do that again. Fortunately this time it's less stressful than the technical (software) issues of first generation. Cheers!"
Is there a way to add a black & white picture on the front screen? I know we want to keep it simple (no camera; etc.) but I think it would be nice to be able to add a screen picture on the phone; if possible. Because occasionally I miss my dogs and want to take a quick look at them; as silly as that sounds.,5 months ago,"I should specify; I don't want a photo library of any kind. But a picture on the screen would be both simple and sharp.

Hmm... hadn't considered this. So in the time being no; there is not a way to do so. Our fear in opting for no images in the UX was always just around how r likely not well images would render on an E-ink screen and how clean the typographic only OS felt. Missing and wanting to look at your dogs is not silly though at all; I know I have used photos of my cat to get me through tough days for sure. I got a portrait of her on my desk now :)"
Thanks for the honest update. I think you've made the right decision and I'm looking forward to seeing the final product.Keep up with the detailed and honest updates. I really appreciate them.,5 months ago,Thanks Graham; really nice to hear that you feel that also makes sense to you as a backer. I'm really itching to have more visuals in the coming updates as things get more tangible. I imagine videos walking through some of the UX pieces and showing the phone in a variety of settings as well as user feedback from some of backers when we kick off beta. We'll of course maintain the honesty :)
Any possibility of dual sim?,5 months ago,"Unfortunately one of biggest challenges has been squeezing everything into the small form factor; and it would not have been possible to squeeze dual SIM ports as far as I can tell. If it were possible though; it would be such a drastic change at this stage in development that it would not be worth doing (add at least 6 months and require re-tooling which beyond our budgets). Thanks for understanding!

Sure; something for Light Phone 3."
Hi Joe & Co.! Super excited to be following this project. I am happy that the final product is coming closer to finalization; & a little sad that we will not have the excitement of comments; ideas; & updates from Light Phone 2 to look forward to! In regards to your response to Vincent P - when using maps; would it be possible to have a turn by turn directions option? I am imagining it as an arrow pointing to where to turn (or which lane to keep in) with one line of text below. What do you think?,5 months ago,Well I do want to find a way to continue the conversation beyond launch; as we do want to continue to make the experience better with updates and more optional tools (you can see the timeline does not end in June when we begin shipping!)... As for maps; I think that is very much what I had in mind as well; but looking forward to April when our software team will be able to explore the tools more deeply.
Thanks for the update; keep up the good work over there! Can't wait to hear how the beta test goes. :-),5 months ago,Thanks Ethan! Hoping that by end of February I'll be using a Light Phone II full time :)
Super excited as well. Please maintain the minimalist experience.,5 months ago,Cheers!
So very excited for this phone. Good job; Light team. P.S. Whatsapp can kick rocks for all I care. Less 3rd party the better; in my opinion.,5 months ago,Thanks Stephen!
Like others; I bought the phone for less features. If users feel the need for these other apps; would a hotspot be out of the question?  Then they could connect their smart phones/laptops to utilize the 4G. Phone; text;  and a hotspot for everything else.,5 months ago,Hotspot is very much something we are planning to have as an option for exactly such a purpose of offsetting users' very specific needs that we may be unlikely to ever support. I just want to remind you that although we may explore additional features that may have no interest to you; does not mean your phone will automatically have those new tools; the phone's functionality (or lack of!) is customizable. Cheers!
Some Questions:I'm interested in either black or grey. For now I chose black; but when would I be able to reconsider for grey?What kind of music integration are you considering?Would text have autocorrect? My vocabulary might become...limited without it haha.How long do you plan on supporting LP2 before considering a follow up project?Which display works best outdoors? Light or dark?How would maps or ride sharing work on a device like this?Can we get a video demo of the product?,5 months ago,"For colors; shipping address and model (region) we will be following up with everyone in the weeks prior to final shipping. We will need a confirmation before we will send the phone; so you'll certainly hear from us and have amble time to switch colors or anything else about your phone. Currently for V1.0 auto-correct is not in the plan; could be possible (and maybe even simple) to include if we find it's crucial to our users; we just have not explored it deeply...

There are no follow up projects on the horizon; our goal is to give this as long of a life as we can. We unintentionally limited the original Light Phone's ability to continue to upgrade with such harsh constraints to hardware and design. We feel that the Light Phone II is a more flexible platform in that regard. Great question tho! Outdoors the two colors are seemingly similar although light color is probably more legible overall; albeit subtly...

Maps; rideshare and music are still very TBD; but they would be simplified versions both aesthetically and in functionality. Maps might be more of a directions list rather than a live map; ride sharing would be typographic based as well and music would likely be limited to a designated playlist of a users choice (be it through third party or their own music most likely). Sorry to not have too much more concrete details there; we will have more in the coming months."
Light Team;I've been following this project on and off for a bit and recently read through the updates and comments. Very excited for the product.Daily I am very quick to consume media of all sorts via my smartphone and recently have been rebelling. We live in an era of instant gratification at a low effort. It becomes too easy to entertain in an unproductive way. I hope to use the LP2 and replace my media intake with creative and fulfilling activities.,5 months ago,Thanks for the kind note Vincent. It's very true; and it's very easy for anyone to be vulnerable to the feeds. Cheers!
"Hey Joe; I'm looking forward to the Light Phone 2 release in April! I just wanted to mention the following regarding e-mail updates as I know they have been an issue for some people. I had originally thought I was not on the Light Phone e-mail list & then discovered that earlier on; when I first contributed to an Indiego Project; I had selected a ""don't e-mail me"" option. I changed my e-mail preferences; and I have gotten all the Light Phone updates ever since. I hope this is helpful to others.",5 months ago,Thanks for sharing! Hope others find that helpful too :) From our experience mass emails tend to be always somewhat problematic; be it from Mailchimp or Indiegogo; but this tip might help!
"Dear Joe and Light team-I do a lot of texting; and with autocorrect being a ""maybe;"" I'm sending a vote for easy-to-access punctuation and simple mid-line editing. It's important that I appear grammatically correct; if only for vanity. Thanks for putting together my dream phone; & I can't wait for April! Andy",5 months ago,Appreciate the feedback. Andy!
I don't recall if this has been answered but: how many contacts will this phone hold?,5 months ago,There is no limitations to the number of contacts stored.
When will the next update be released?,5 months ago,Just sent it out today; sorry it took so long; we wanted to confirm everything 100% with our various suppliers before announcing our timeline delay.
"My 2-cents: the phone's core promise is to provide calling and texting. Features that enhance those two functions (Bluetooth; voice commands/dictation; contact manager) are great. Anything non-core (NFC/payment capabilities; 3rd party messaging; maps; ride hailing) should be avoided. Those capabilities are already offered on smartphones; and more importantly; dilute the benefits of decommoditizing your life by having a phone you can't buy things with! Please don't build a ""shitty smartphone.""",5 months ago,That's a fair point; Robert; appreciate the feedback!
I just wanted the creators to be aware of this. https://kyoex.com/docomo-kyocera-ky-01l-card-keitai-minimalist-phone-unlocked/,5 months ago,Yes we've seen and actually have played around with one ourselves. Thanks for thinking to pass along our way though!
Just joined in here and there are an awful lot of comments; so sorry if this has already been addressed but...  as Ive opted for the black model; what protection does the body have against scratches? I ended up opting for the black (and expecting the odd mark) rather than white (and getting colour marks on it from touch & materials). Am I wrong guys?,5 months ago,"Hi Brad;  Great question; and we can share more tests about this as we get to final aesthetic details; but the paint of both versions have protective coatings. I'm not sure the exact names off the top of my head; but there is some ""accelerated life tests"" that are performed to ensure it can withhold from minor scratches. For example they have a ""purse test"" that puts the phone into a fake purse with everyday objects like keys and coins and shake it around to simulate longer term use."
@brandon.raper - the lightphone already exists if you want completely barebones...,5 months ago,
Can you provide more details about the Light Phone portal? Will managing tools; syncing contacts and all of that kind of thing be dependent on a remote service (i.e your servers); or can it be done locally with my laptop?Also; how's beta testing looking? Will you provide developer kits at all?,5 months ago,"Currently it's handled through web interface but we want to see what we can offer in terms of what can be done locally; I don't have enough details at the moment. As highlighted in an update posted today; Beta schedule has pushed back a few weeks; although we will be starting some of that testing with the phones we have now in February still. The developer kit is not going to be ready; sorry if there was any confusion but it's lower on our priority list for launch thanks for understanding!

It would be ideal to be able to do this locally; perhaps with a browser extension. I'm not really keen on piping all of my contacts through a third-party server just to manage them on my phone."
Hi Joe; dont you think this might be a useful service (DOSTUPNO) on your device? Do you think this could be applied to Light Phone? THX,5 months ago,I'm sorry but I'm not familiar with it? It might be useful; but we are definitely trying to keep the Light phone features as minimal as possible :)
For the love of god - make this as bare bones as possible. All you that want MORE out of what this was promised to be; either need to wait for the not-so-light-phone 3 OR get an iDevice.,5 months ago,"""not-so-light-phone 3"" lol. Cheers; Brandon"
Hi Joe; just joined the campaign; very excited to get my hands on the phone! Is it possible to get a link to the surveys; please? Thanks; John,5 months ago,Ah sorry just getting through the comments but actually just emailed you the link as I saw your email first! Hope all is well :)
Hi Joe! Will you be able to mute the microphone during calls? This is very important at least for me; since I am intending to have the LP2 as my main phone and because of my job I have many conference calls. Thank you!,5 months ago,Yep!
Hi Joe; Do we know how far off the April date we are with this yet? Just asking as my phone looks like it might be dying!,5 months ago,"Hi Bari;I waited to reply to this until I sent the formal update. We had to announce a delay to mass production today. Beta is expected for March/April and mass production kicks off late May with shipping begging mid-June through July. Let me know if you have questions!

glimpses of the phone look awesome! I think delays are inevitable but at least it's for a good reason! I backed the nextbit robin a couple of years back and that was all over the place by the time it came to shipping!Although; looks like I'll need a phone to tide me over..."
Hey there; looking forward to using the phone! Will there be a way to block calls? Phone spammers have gotten out of hand.,5 months ago,Yep; we intend to have a block caller list in the settings.
I just want to emphasize that I believe a feature that permits owners to automatically forward to voicemail all calls from numbers not in one's contacts is one which makes the device less intrusive for users. Doing this on my iPhone has proven by far the most effective means of avoiding spam calls that I have tried and not having that ability would actually defeat the purpose of the Light Phone; to take back control of our lives from technology and those who use it to manipulate us.,5 months ago,Thanks Gregory; I think that's a setting that seems aligned with the Light Phone for sure. We had similar filter settings on the first Light Phone (although that phone was limited to 9 speed dials). I'll see what we can do; but this should be relatively simple for us to include in the settings as an option. Thanks again for pointing it out and hope all is well!
Just to add a vote against overloading the phone with features. I believe the best products are ones that focus on doing a few things very well. As soon as the feature-list grows; compromises have to be made and the overall experience suffers.it's probably as difficult making a simple but effective phone as it is trying to make a 'smartphone'. The difficulty lies in deciding what to include; what to leave out and how to deliver a simple but compelling experience.Looking forward to it!,5 months ago,Really appreciate the comment; and totally agree. Thanks for the encouragement; and excited to share a very light; Light Phone with you soon!
An idea here; in terms of those folks who (like me) want basically nothing but a phone for calls; and others who want a bunch of other features (texts; timers; directions; etc.): how about an option to disable whichever functions you don't want via the Lightphone sync? That is; you plug the phone into your computer at home; and via the Lightbox software check what you want and don't; and that holds until the next time you sync--lock on the fridge;,5 months ago,Hi Geoffrey; Thanks for the suggestion and happy to inform you that is more or less how the system in currently structured. The phone will ship with core functionality (messages/calls... a phone!). The user then choose to optional add addition 'tools' using the user dashboard (website)... or not! We never want anyone to have tools that are not relevant to them and we understand everyone will have slightly different needs. Cheers!
a) Thank You; can't wait for April  b) Voting Down the Messaging idea - no WhatsApp; no nuthin; SMS only please. Accidentally left my phone at home the other day; best day I've had in ages; only thing I missed was music. Go Light.,5 months ago,Cheers; Justin!!
Hi Joe;How about a simple notepad? Just a single screen for one sms-long memo; erase button and that's it. Useful and ultra-light little tool. It's just an idea hopefully worth consideration :) Cheers!,5 months ago,Totally under consideration; especially something as simple as you describe. Although not quite the same; but another user suggested the possibility of also just texting oneself; I remember on my smartphone often sending myself emails just with a thought so I could remember later when I got to my computer. That being said we've had enough users ask about a notepad that we will certainly explore it; thanks!
Where can I read details of the operating system planned for the LP2 and developing 3rd party apps for it?Apologies if this has already been discussed but IndieGoGo makes it really hard to search earlier updates & comments. I encourage you to set up a forum on your own website and/or on XDA and move discussions there.,5 months ago,Totally understand re:Indie; but honestly there are not a lot of details to be found at the moment. While we do want to come out with an SDK for users to create their own custom 'tools'; the details of such are not flushed out nor is a firm timeline for its availability.  We thought about a forum; but were afraid it'd complicate things further with needing everyone to create an account and to check two places for info on the project. After launch that could make a lot of sense though!
Re: WhatsApp / WeChat / FB Messenger / Telegram / Skype etcFor the LP2 to be a viable communications tool I really think it needs to support the dominant instant messaging app in each region. Most people now rely on IM apps for the essential communications involved in getting stuff done and organising everyday life. This isn't really optional. In my case its WhatsApp + WeChat.The apps don't have to support the full functionality of the Android/iOS apps but  basic messaging needs to work.,5 months ago,It's certainly something we're interested in exploring; I do understand your point that it's how many people communicate these days. It would need to be a 'light' version of whatever platform; stripped to just messaging and perhaps calls. In polling backers there are a lot of variety in the platforms people use; which is another issue. There are also concerns with platforms like Whatsapp; being that it's owned by Facebook who seem to lack any sense or morals when it comes to user privacy. Cheers
One of the survey questions was in regards to autocorrect. I typically dont like autocorrect; but I know e-ink is typically very slow and difficult to type on. I guess I was curious as to how fast the e-ink tech is. If its quick; it shouldnt be required; if slow; its a must. Just wanted to add that comment since there was no place to write any on the survey.Keep up the great work. Looking forward to the device.,5 months ago,"Also; it may be a carrier based service; but I think the best solution to the internet based messaging without using a service requiring an app would be wi-fi calling services. It works with SMS too if I remember correctly.

Appreciate the feedback regarding auto correct! I think that is a fair judgement of the need (or not) for auto-correct. It's certainly something we can add as a future option; we were trying to prioritize some of these additional features based on how important they are to our users. We would love to have some sort of internet based messaging/calling option; especially in regards to international use; but the tricky thing is finding a solution that works well for all of our users..."
Apologies if this has been asked before; however will there be a service to add a card (NFC) for payments etc. I'm all for disconnecting as a i moved from my note 8 to a 3310; but I agree certain tools are just damn helpful. On the plus side my brain is no longer being wired for short tern thinking; Good tools like compass navigation; hot spotting; NFC; reminders. Tools that dont wire us to keep checking the phone but empower us to become efficient. Lastly thanks guys for doing this project.,5 months ago,"Hey! Thanks for the kind words and support. Agree; the phone is all about tools! Unfortunately I regret to inform you that the Light Phone II does not have NFC in the hardware; I'm sorry if that was a misunderstanding.

Not a probem at all :-)"
The only thing I would really like to see is a built in Pedometer for counting steps without carrying another device.,5 months ago,Hi Richard; Thanks for the suggestion! In theory; Pedometer does not seem like a distraction or tool we'd want to avoid for philosophical reasons. I would need to explore with the engineers if our hardware is capable of working as an accurate pedometer with the sensors we have (pretty similar sensors to smartphone; so likely it could). Will add to our list of potential future tools to explore; thanks again!
Long time follower; first time commenter. Cant wait for LP2; it will be a significant upgrade from the idiot MP02 phone I am using now. I think Punkt forgot one key aspect of a dumb phone; it should be easy and intuitive to use. Good luck guys.,5 months ago,Cheers; Dominic; thanks for the support!!
Since there will be a clock; I was hoping there would also be a timer included in the LP2. A timer comes in handy a lot when cooking; taking breaks; or doing the pomodoro technique.,5 months ago,Hi Aaron; Totally understand how important that can be. We just asked about timer tool on the recent survey and it is likely something we will have for launch even. Cheers!
"I would also like to mention the open-source program ""Syncthing"".  It is an incredibly useful program for automatically syncing data to and from a phone over wifi to or from another device; is also open source; and is something I use every day on my current smartphone.  It reduces hassle and distraction when it comes to backups and importing of data (e.g. music files).Thanks; I'm excited to get this product in hand.",5 months ago,
Hi; I am would like to ask for support for the open-source Matrix protocol ( https://matrix.org/blog/home/ ) as part of the messaging features for this phone.  (IRC could also be interesting; but Matrix sees like a better fit.)A text client for Matrix would be a useful wifi alternative to cellular-only SMS; syncs gracefully with other computer devices; and is founded on services and protocols which respect their users with end-to-end encryption and freedom of choice among service providers.,5 months ago,Whoops; pardon my typos!  I'd edit my comment if I could.
"Re: WhatsAppYou said it yourself; ""Light was born as a refreshing alternative to the tech monopolies"".  Please don't put a Facebook product on this phone.  Keep it light; my dude; and thank you so much for your continued updates and involvement with us.",5 months ago,"Gah of course; that's where my comment went...sorry for the twofer.  I guess there's no option to delete/edit comments?

It's a very appreciated comment; and maybe it's good that it's here twice :)"
"Re: WhatsApp""Light was formed as a refreshing alternative to the tech monopolies.""  Is adding a Facebook product to this phone in line with this?  Keep it light; my dude; and thank you so much for your continuous updates and involvement with us.",5 months ago,
Although it somewhat goes against the Light ethos; if sending texts via desktop/browser is important to you then you can use Google Voice. I used it when I was using a punkt mp01. It's super convenient but there are two drawbacks: 1) It costs $20 to port your number to Google Voice. This means that when you get your Light Phone you'll want a new phone number that you will link to your ported Google Voice number...,5 months ago,"...2) Google Voice assigns anyone you communicate with a new number when you receive a call or text from them. So if you call a contact and want them to see it's from your old number (now on GV); you have to use the newly created  number that google voice created. I'm realizing this is pretty tricky to describe but if someone needs desktop texting badly enough (plus the other benefits of Google Voice) then it might be worth it.

Thanks for sharing that suggestion! We definitely understand how confusing it can be trying to describe the different phone numbers and options. For the original Light Phone we created a platform similar to GV in a sense; but specific to calls and it  maintained your preferred number through the system. It never quite got as seamless as we hoped; lots to do with apple or carrier limitations. It was impossible for us to handle texts that way so we are not using that for Light Phone II

Very cool you were able to explore that in the past.  Thanks for the reply; Joe."
"I have been reading through the comments. Each one says; ""I want...."" I know it is important to consider the user. However; I really hope you make a minimalist phone that helps disconnect. I would hate to see a beautiful idea bogged down by all of the input from the 'I WANT' crowd.",5 months ago,"Genuinely appreciate the note. I totally agree; we definitely don't want to lose sight of the 'light' in our phone; and I don't think we have. With our original Light Phone we were so strict and idealistic in our limitations; that this time we're trying to understand everyone's needs and how we might find a suitable balance for our users; but it's important that we remember we aren't making an ""everything for everyone phone"". We're making a Light Phone that is certainly not for everyone.  Cheers"
the Whatsapp workaround posted by @Chris Foster might be ok; but it means you are going to have another phone connected all the time.I've done a bit of a test since I posted originally on it; I've used around 50 sms messages and whatsapp is more than 18 times that as we use it for work.If there was a whatsapp lite version it would mean I could genuinely replace my smart phone - I'm sure it would be possible given they let nokia use it for the s40 range; I guess it's maybe a european thing?,5 months ago,"Hi Bari; I understand that workaround might not be ideal; but hopefully useful to some users; at least in the short term. It very well might be possible to incorporate our own ""light"" version of Whatsapp; I just have been conservative in our promising because we haven't deeply explored it yet and don't want to set unrealistic expectations. I was unaware of the Nokia s40 but will explore that as an example; any other references that backers know of that we can study are very welcome; thanks!

Joe; that's great - as I said before it's not a deal breaker; still backing this - it was just that this could push the thing up a level if i could completely ditch my smartphone! If I can avoid having the lightphone as an additional or complimentary phone that nails it for me!thanks for replying and keep up the good work!"
I'm a recent backer; though like @BardoeBess I've been watching you all since Lightphone 1. Also like Bardoe; I would miss podcasts on my device. I didn't get the last survey so I don't know if that was mentioned there; but I'd like to put a vote in for it. The progress you all have made is great and I'm really looking forward to seeing more updates!,5 months ago,Hi Jared; can you please shoot a note about the survey to support@thelightphone.com and we can certainly send the link. Unfortunately there is no way to automatically send it to new backers when they pledge as we'd like; sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for taking the time to share your feedback!
Hello! First of all; thank you very much for everything you've done already and certainly you keep doing to get the best device possible. As a graphic designer I'm curious about what typography are you going to use for the phone's operating system and I'd love to hear what was based your choice on. Also (no pressure) do you know more or less when is going to be published the next update?Awesome work. Hope all is well. Thanks again!,5 months ago,"Hi Gonzalo;  (I'm also a graphic designer or at least went to college for it) We're using the typeface ""Akkurat"" by the Lineto Foundry. We explored a lot of options and this particular typeface was recommended actually by my college thesis teacher; thanks Joe M.! We're waiting for confirmation on a few crucial timeline pieces from our suppliers before sharing the next update because it may impact our schedule and we'd want to let everyone know asap if that's the case. Expect update next week!"
Great to have finally pushed that pay button; been watching you guys since lightphone 1. Really excited about this project. I have seen some noise around music; for me I can happily take an MP3 player with me for music but if its not stepping over the line it would be fantastic to listen to podcasts on the lightphone? I think that is really all I'm gonna feel I miss.,5 months ago,Cheers and thanks for the support! It still blows my mind that we've been able to keep the project going forward and gaining momentum since we launched the original Light Phone. Noted the feedback about podcasts; thanks for sharing and hope all is well!
Hello again Joe! I read in one of the comments that you are working in a case for this phone. Will it be included in the original package or will I have to purchase it separately? If it is the second case; will it be available when the LP2 is launched? For me it would be very nice to have it protected since the beginning. Thank you!,5 months ago,Hi Jose; Great questions. We think it's important to have a case offering for launch as you mention. It won't be in the packaging itself; but an added/optional accessory. You will certainly have the opportunity to receive the phone and case together from day 1 because we will follow up with everyone to confirm your shipping/color/model prior to sending out the phones and at that time we will ask about the case. Hope that makes sense!
Hi all;On the WhatsApp front: I've managed to get Tasker (an Android automation app) to forward messages as SMSs; and send the response as a reply in WhatsApp.Youll need Tasker and AutoNotificationSet up a profile to intercept notifications (+ button -> Event -> Plugin -> AutoNotification -> Intercept)Configure by ticking 'Has Reply Action' and choose WhatsApp in the Apps list...,5 months ago,"In the attached new task; add actions to store the WhatsApp details (Variables -> Variables Set; Name - %whatsAppSender; To - %anreplyaction)and send an SMS (under phone) to the your phone number; with the Message of %antitlebig: %antextbigAdd another profile to capture the SMS reply (Event -> Phone -> Received Text); set the type to SMS and the content to WhatsAppReply*...

Add an actions to strip off the WhatsAppReply from the replied SMS (Variables -> Variable Split; Name - %SMSRB; Splitter - WhatsAppReply)and send the WhatsApp reply (Plugin -> AutoNotification -> Reply; configure with Reply Action ID - %whatsAppSender; Reply Test - %SMSRB(

2))You have to start your SMS reply with WhatsAppReply so Tasker can identify it and youll need a 2nd sim card in the android phone to send and receive the SMSs. It wont cope with multiple simultaneous WhatsApp messages from different senders as the %whatsAppSender will get overridden but other than that it seems to work well.

You also may need to set the 'Cooldown' time of the intercept profile (long press on the profile; cog symbol at the top) to 5 seconds and add a display state off or you may get multiple SMSs sent. Indiegogo formatting is horrendous; maybe there's some way of posting a guide with pictures Joe; if anyone is interested?

Hey Chris! Wow thanks so much for sharing this; this is really interesting for many of our backers who have expressed their desire for Whatsapp on Light Phone II. This could work really well on our Medium Blog where we imagine we'd share other ""hacks/tutorials"" for users to get the most out of their Light Phone II. I'll shoot you an email to the address of your backing; thanks so much for thinking of the community in sharing your discovery!"
Will the LP2 support international texts and calls? I have to communicate with America; UK; some of Europe(mostly Spain); Cambodia; and Saudi Arabia. Any ideas on what my availability would be. Id love to use your service. Thanks,5 months ago,"Hi Dylan; Hoping that I understand your question correctly. The phone is capable of texting internationally; but depending on your SIM/service plan it could have additional costs. It is not ""free"" like with platforms such as Whatsapp or Skype etc. that use the internet for such communication and are limited to users of those platforms. Let me know if I can further clarify; thanks!

I was hoping to use the light company as my SP."
2 things - 1- I may have missed it with so many comments to page through- Has it been determined if Light Phone 2 will have Bluetooth?  Seems like a big update when you know.2- FYI only -You all ever reached out to Waituntil8th.org on outreach front?  Light phone vision certainly complementary to their mission....,5 months ago,Hi Charles; No problem; understand there has been a lot of comments (and unfortunately no good way to search through them... Indiegogo take notes please!). Yes Bluetooth was confirmed actually while we still running the campaign as part of our stretch goal. Thanks for the heads up; I believe they actually reached out to us during the campaign; and Kai has been speaking with them ongoing; totally agree about alignment of mission! Appreciate you taking the time to share :)
Just ordered two; one for me and one for my daughter. Can't wait until April!I have already ditched my iPhone except in wifi (basically now an iPod) for a Nokia 3310 3G. Voice calling was great; but going back to T9 texting was a just a step too far. What I hope for in the final product are:Good talk and textingContact space for ~200Multi-event alarm clockCall blocking and auto routing of non-contacts to voicemailDirectionsA hotspot and a calculator would be a nice extras,5 months ago,"In the survey I listed some music services. That would be a nice add-on; but is not required by me; especially if the LP II can serve as a hotspot. If I had to choose; I'd much rather have the hotspot.

Appreciate the thorough and thoughtful feedback; Gregory. Excited to have you as a backer!

I actually used that Nokia phone for a week myself and had a few gripes about it too; but I agree T9 was certainly "" a step too far"". I was surprised you couldn't remove the Twitter; Facebook; Internet browser; not that one needs to use them per say; but just felt weird that it was fixed in the OS. Cheers

Yeah; I don't understand the point of having Facebook; Twitter; etc. on a feature phone. My whole point of getting such a phone was to shun all that. I got a non-data plan; so none of it works; but; as you mentioned; you can't delete any of the apps; which clutter the screen.I can't wait to get the Light Phone II. It appears to have all I want and need and none of the distractions I want to shun."
Hey joe still havent got the survey email nothing show up in junk mail can you post the link here plz,5 months ago,"We're trying to keep the link private for Indie backers. I saw your email come in and replied again; are you still not seeing the replies? I'm so sorry this has been difficult. Perhaps the email associated on your Indie account is misspelled and that's why you didn't receive the initial email or mine from earlier? Regardless I saw your message and replied; please let me know when you get a chance that it worked. Cheers

unfortunately same problem. might be a server problem or mail app issue. frustrating i miss all notification for updates and survey. so i tried changing my email on indiegogo and see if that works for you. i checked my setting on indiegogo and everything look fine even ticked boxes to receive notifications

Thanks for your patience. I have just resent it to the updated address from both Light Phone email as well as my personal email. Really hoping it gets through! Thanks again for understanding."
Any updates on the IP rating for LP2? any kind of water or dust proofing in mind?,5 months ago,"Hi! The Light Phone II has a rating or IPx3; which is ""spraying water proof; defined as water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60 degrees""."
Hey Joe. Just checking in to see if you have been able to confirm compatibility between Verizon SIM cards and the LP2. Thanks!,5 months ago,"We have not confirmed in an actual Light Phone II prototype yet; but I did see that some of our team were in the process of getting the Verizon SIMs. In theory the network should be compatible and we've successfully tested AT&T and TMobile. We are fairly confident Verizon will work as well; and I'll let everyone know as soon as we can confirm that for sure. Thanks for understanding.

Very good. Thank you!"
Hi Joe;  would you please tell me if light phone can show Chinese characters simple &traditional)? Thanks,5 months ago,Unfortuantely by our initial launch; the Light Phone will likely only support english characters. We do hope to offer more language support; but as a super small team we don't feel confident we can pull it off yet. I understand that may really effect your Light Phone II experience; and if you'd like to request a refund for your pledge that is always an option; just email us at support@thelightphone.com. Thanks for understanding!
Great survey guys; thanks for sharing! I speak for everyone when I say THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT PROJECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5 months ago,Appreciate you Ben!! Thanks for the encouragement and continued support!!
For those worried about MMS; Joe has already clarified in a number of comment responses (although you'd probably have to scroll way down to find them) that text only MMS (such as group messages) will work properly on LP2.,5 months ago,Yes! Thanks for clarifying this; I realize I misspoke in saying NO MMS when I really meant no images/gifs/videos/audio files. Appreciate you taking the time to point that out! Sorry anyone who was confused by the wording in the survey!
Some questions: 1) will there be an option to turn off wifi and data as desired? 2) Will we be notified of new voicemails? I have cruddy service in my apartment sometimes and calls often go straight to voicemail. 3) will the beta testers be allowed to post photos of the phone online? If I don't get picked as a tester; I want to see pics. Yes; I'm that excited.,5 months ago,"Hi Crystle; Thanks for the support. Wifi can certainly be turned off (off by default); and there is an airplane mode which will turn off cell signal. There is no way to access the internet at all; data used is simply for updates or potential future tools (optional); hope that makes sense! Voicemail is something you will be able to access; but we want to learn more about how various carriers will handle them and so we can build a good experience for them. I have not thought about whether...

... we might ask backers not to share photos publicly. I don't think we will; but regardless and to answer your question we as the Light Phone II campaign will certainly share many photos and videos with all of our backers in in the updates!

Thanks for the response! To clarify about data; basically if anything needs to use data (updates for the phone or tools) would I be able to prevent it from using that data? I'd like to keep my data usage for any given month to 100 mb or less; since I use Ting and get billed in tiers of usage. I don't mind using wifi when able; just hoping not to use data any more than necessary. Thanks! Sorry for being confusing :P"
So did I understand that survey right? The phone isn't going to properly receive MMS? That's.... infuriating to say the least. I will have to back out. One of the most basic of features I need in the phone. My boss group chats too often to not have that available on my phone.,5 months ago,"Sorry if there is a misunderstanding Aaron; I think I misspoke when I said ""MMS"". The plan is still to support group messaging; we simply will not be supporting images/videos/gifs/audiofiles etc. which I wrongly labeled as MMS. That being said; we will always offer a refund to anyone no longer interested; please shoot us an email to support@thelightphone.com and we can sort that out for you. Thanks for understanding and for supporting our project!

That's great to hear! Sorry for the over-reaction. I have such high hopes for this phone. I am desperate to get away from my smart phone. But it just isn't possible with out group text. Happy to hear it will be supported!"
How would the beta program work? Would you get a beta test phone and then option for upgrading to the final product later? Or thats the only phone for you?,5 months ago,Hi Sam; Great question. Last time we did Beta; the phones themselves (hardware) were the same exact phone as what we mass produced. Post-beta we gave all of our backers the latest software update and that phone was theirs to keep because nothing had physically changed. In the unlikely case that there needs to be some sort of change to the device itself (hardware) then we'd likely collect the beta phones and replace with final products. Hope that makes sense!
The problem with not displaying any MMS messages whatsoever is that the user would miss out on group texts. Group texts are sent as MMS; not SMS.,5 months ago,Hi Kenneth; Thanks for pointing this out. Sorry for the confusion. I misspoke by saying NO MMS all together; I should have been more clear that I was simply referring to the images/audiofiles/gifs/videos that would not be displayed. Group messaging support is very much still the plan.  Hope all is well!
Hi Joe!  I'm looking forward to going light with the Light Phone 2! I'm an entrepreneur also; and I really like/ respect what you and your team are doing on multiple levels! I have a question regarding the outside protection of the device. Will you (or perhaps a partner) be offering a simple phone case and/ or screen protector?,5 months ago,Hi Blake; Thanks so much for the support and kind words! We do plan to offer at least one protective case by launch; but have not yet finalized the details of it. It would be cool to see others produce cases for Light Phone II as well and hopefully we can create more options for cases in due time also. Cheers!
I agree with the other backer(s) who emphasized just building talk; text; maps; alarm; and potentially ride sharing into the LPII. Even though music is a 'nice' feature for some; the intent behind me (and many others) buying this phone is to leave the entertainment and consumption side of our devices behind.  As someone who has searched for a simple; decently designed; 'smart enough' phone; the LPII is a breath of fresh air.,5 months ago,"Thanks for the feedback! I totally see your point and our focus is certainly on the tools that you listed out. Music is a little bit of a stretch; but it's been really important to enough backers that we want to try to have some options available if we can pull them off in a ""light"" enough way. That being said; I just want to reiterate that any ""tools"" we may release in the future will always be completely optional to you; so your phone will remain as light as you'd prefer. Hope all is well!"
Hi joe; I didnt get the survey and I emailed for one. No response yet.,5 months ago,Hmmm weird and sorry about that inconvenience. I just emailed it to you again from our support email using the address we have on file. Hopefully that will get through to you. Let me know if you don't see it? Thanks!
If we are interested in being a BETA tester; does that mean that the phone we ordered will be one with more flaws possibly; or do we test it and then return it and get the phone when it is ironed out? Thanks!,5 months ago,Great question! Pasting my reply to another backer: Last time we did Beta; the phones themselves (hardware) were the same exact phone as what we mass produced. Post-beta we gave all of our backers the latest software update and that phone was theirs to keep because nothing had physically changed. In the unlikely case that there needs to be some sort of change to the device itself (hardware) then we'd likely collect the beta phones and replace with final products. Hope that makes sense; Garrett
I agree the survey is cool. Sms needs to work for most things and to have a backup to email for messages types not handled is excellent. Re music....And Bluetooth codecs..I bet a lot of light phone buyers love music and would like to see AAC/APTXHD included.,5 months ago,Hi Eric; Appreciate the feedback! Hoepfully we can make that feature available (forwarding media via email). I'm honestly not sure about the details of the codecs; but I can try to find out more; thanks for understanding!
"Thank you for helping us escape media overload that exists to induce us to overspend.   Every message eventually leads us to some ""opportunity"" to buy or sign up for things we do not need.  I am looking forward to breaking away and being an example to others to follow suit.",5 months ago,"Very well said! It's so true; at the end of the day; almost everything is leading to some sale moment; it's quite crazy. Thanks for the support and can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you this spring!

In addition to lowering our overall anxiety and helping us to focus; limiting access to our electronic lives can perhaps make us less vulnerable to the ubiquitous (and relentless) hack-attacks of modern times.  I deliberately work hard to preserve what little privacy I (may) have left and am glad for a mechanism by which I can close the door or pull down a shade; if only temporarily so.High praise and happy new year.  'Peace to you and yours."
Thanks for sending out the survey!  I wanted to comment on the question about MMS.  I LOVE the idea of being able to receive multimedia messages via e-mail; and I don't think it would be worth bothering to display on the e-ink screen.  Just to keep a bug in your ear about this: some carriers/phones will send text-only messages as MMS. I hope that the Light 2 will handle this!,5 months ago,"Hi Rocky; Great point and I realize now from a few other backers that I misspoke about MMS. I should have instead said ""images/gifs/videos/audio etc."" because the phone does handle MMS in the instance of text and group text messages; but that's a very valid point to bring up and much appreciated! I really hope that the emailing media feature is easy to implement; seems to have a pretty positive response so far. Hope all is well :)"
Am very concerned by the lack of WhatsApp. Hardly anyone in western Europe under the age of 50 uses SMS/MMS any more - we are all on WhatsApp (has been the case for years now). Facebook messenger is a distant second. My SMS inbox is only used for receiving verification messages (couriers; password verifications; phone updates). WhatsApp 'out of office' function can't solve the problem either because it has to be online to work (2 phones can't use the same SIM/number).,5 months ago,"Hi Regan; I do understand your point completely; although I don't personally use it many of our European friends echo your point. Unfortunately at this stage we don't yet have a plan to include Whatsapp on the Light Phone II. We do certainly plan to explore what might be possible; but we don't know how difficult or feasible it will be to make a 'light' version of Whatsapp that's compatible with your existing phone. Our priority right now is delivering the simple core phone experience...

... That being said; I understand that no Whatsapp may be a deal breaker for you and just want to reiterate that we will always offer a full refund for your pledge (just email us at support@thelightphone.com). I appreciate your understanding regardless and thanks again for the support!"
Emphasizing; just give us talk; text; maps; alarm; and maybe ride sharing. That is what is essential today. I can buy a GPS but I won't. Maps and ride sharing allow you to fully be confident in a different city without having to need further technology. I check every day for an update; too excited for this. Also; I would absolutely love to beta test and would be very objective to make your product as good as possible.,5 months ago,"Thanks Devin! Appreciate the feedback and personally agree with that feature set. We'll continue to keep the door open to other features like music because many many backers have expressed their interest in it; but our focus is certainly on those core functionalities. Appreciate your willingness to help us beta test the phone too!

Absolutely; no problem. You guys are killing it with responding diligently to backers by the way."
Hi Joe;Will the TP2 support european keyboard characters (ISO Latin 2); please? I'm specificaly interested in Czech diacritics (     etc.). If not; how will such characters appear in received messages? Thanks!,5 months ago,"Hello and great question! I wish I had a more concrete answer at the moment; and yes our goal is to support those characters; but at this time it's in the ""nice to have"" bucket of our engineering tasks. It will likely be finalized by the time we launch; but I just wanted to be honest that it's still very much a to-do item and not a finalized feature. We do consider it an important aspect to the keyboard and would really like to have it there from day 1. Hope that makes sense!

Thank you for the reply; Joe. Makes sence indeed. With phone this simple and.. well.. light; you guys are literally making my long time wish come true; so while I can't wait to hold it in my hand I'm also ready to be patient with its features and updates catching up with time. Thanks again and best of luck to you and the team!"
Hi! Wishing to cancel. Can you help?,5 months ago,"Hi Ryan; Not a problem. Unfortunately Indiegogo doesn't have a really easy ""refund"" button (because they want project creators to know they have the necessary funds to deliver said project); so I'll have to ask you to email support@thelightphone.com so we can refund. Thanks for understanding and for supporting our project!"
Hi there Joe my wife and I are excited to try our Lightphones in a few months. Given the current discussion about privacy and security as it relates to communications companies; what can you say about your plans to protect user data? Does Lightphone store user data? Sell it to 3rd parties? What about location data? Thanks for any insight you can provide.,5 months ago,"Hi Josh; Great questions! We as Light do not store user data aside from the account email/password. All of your user history is stored directly on the phone itself and we cannot access it. Definitely will not be selling anyone's data; email or anything to third parties ever! Location tracking is completely off by default. It will only be pinged if one calls 911 (or respective emergency number in your region) which is an FCC requirement for emergency situations...

If we have tools like rideshare/directions; there would be some sharing of a user's location to that third party (i.e. Lyft for example); and by choosing to add said tool the user would agree to that. A user does not of course; need to add any additional tools to their phone and will not have their location ever shared in such a case. Some parents have asked about phone tracking for their children using Light Phone II and that is something we have yet to deeply explore and is still speculative.

Hope that makes sense!

I should maybe add that because we are currently the only one's building the tools for the Light Phone II; we have full control over what information would get potentially shared (like in the ridesharing example) and we will always share as little information as is possible for the experience to work smoothly. The app would not be tracking one's location in the background; like many of our smartphone apps unfortunately are doing. Cheers

Thanks for the reply Joe I appreciate it! It all makes sense. Looking forward to upgrading from my iPhone :)"
"Hi Joe;1. When do you think the next update will be posted? 2. Where are you at in your ""Merge / Alpha"" timeline?3. Can you post final photos? 4. What network provider did you partner with?5. Are you at CES?Cheers!",5 months ago,1. Most likely next week; but waiting to make sure our PVT kicks off correctly before posting. If there is a delay we'd want to notify everyone in the next update. 2. Very close; most of our team is headed out to Taipei again tomorrow to try to resolve the last lingering issues. Will cover all of this more thoroughly in next update. 3. Don't have final photos yet; but we are looking forward to it when we do! 4. For the Light service AT&T is the provider 5. Nope; we're swamped with development
I've searched because I thought I remembered some update on it; but I could not find any mention of call forwarding. Was that ruled out; or in; or TBD? Anyone recall?,5 months ago,Sorry if this is sending twice; I thought I just submitted a reply but it didn't post. It is not ruled out and likely will be there in our initial launch including in the settings. We are planning to ask about it in the survey so that if in a time crunch before launch we had to chose between call forwarding or say auto-reply messaging we would know which was most important to everyone; but in general I think call forwarding is a pretty expected standard phone feature. Thanks for asking!
Hi Joe;  I did not receive a survey.  Did I miss it or is it still in the making.  your hard work is appreciated.,5 months ago,My fault; the survey has not yet gone out; it's about 80% ready and I just keep getting tied up with time sensitive deadlines in this crunch time. Nothing on the survey is as pressing for our immediate needs so I have let it fall on the back burner a few times; sorry for the misleading estimate on when it'd go out. It will for sure go out this week.
Hallo Joe; looking forward to have the device. Im based in Italy and available as beta tester if you need this. Best,5 months ago,Hi Vinicio; Thanks for your support of our project and willingness to jump into beta and offer support in perfecting the phone experience. We are planning to do a lottery style draw of beta testers from the pool of interested backers. We will be sending our latest survey out this week and it will have the opportunity to sign up to potentially be picked as a beta tester. Because there will be limited amount of phones available this felt like the most fair way to do so; thanks for understanding!
"Hi Joe! I would like to add an additional vote for having a hotspot feature. Very handy when travelling. Another person had brought up the idea of emoji support. I think it's an absolute must in 2019 to have some way of displaying them. I have a dumb phone right now and have trouble deciphering texts from friends sometimes. A possible ""light"" solution might be to just display a text version of the emoji like: ""Can't wait for the game! :smile: :raised-hands:""",5 months ago,"Hi Noah; Noted re: hotspot. It's been one of the most requested additional features and is on our priority list for sure. Hoping it will be available with initial launch is our goal; but not 100% positive yet. We've been studying emoji support a little more and actually will likely have three options for users. We can show the emojis as they are in b&w; translate to text as you mention or hide them for users who would rather never see an emoji again...

I totally agree it's important for context to understand what you were sent. I tried a flip phone for a while that did not support incoming emojis at all and it was difficult to say the least. That being said; we don't currently plan to have users send emojis from the Light Phone II; but just a way to understand what was sent to them. Cheers and thanks for the feedback.

Amazing! Thanks for the quick response; can't wait for the phone!"
Just wanted to say that I am in love with the idea of the product! I feel too many people in the comments are trying to breathe too many 'features' into the product that take away from its simplicity and straightforwardness. Call; text; rideshare; directions; alarm; music; (hopefully a calculator) are all that's needed. Looking forward to see if I can integrate this with TMobile Digits; which will allow me to use the same # on multiple devices which shouldn't be difficult for me at all. Thanks!,5 months ago,"Cheers Aaron! It's been an interesting discussion to watch unfold with everyone around what we each think an ""essentials only phone"" should have. We will definite stick to our 'light' instincts whenever possible; but we do want to understand everyone's needs and make the phone as practical as possible without taking away from its philosophy of being 'designed to be used as little as possible'. I appreciate you chiming in!"
Hi Joe!  I've just made my pre-order.  I have four questions: 1. Will the light phone 2 be able to be used as a hot spot?  2. I just read about the possibility of getting a light version of WhatsApp...  That would be great! 3. Finally will you be able to get an Uber with this phone?  4. Will you launch the grey color? Thank you!,5 months ago,"Hello! Thanks for the support. Hotspot is a goal of ours and one of our most requested additional features. We are not 100% positive at this time if it will be in v1.0 or come shortly after initial launch; but it is something we definitely plan to offer. Whatsapp is an idea; but there are more unkowns in that tool; and it may be some time before it's available if it is possible at all. Just want to be realistic there; but hopefully we can offer it for those interested backers! ...

3. We do plan to offer ridesharing tools (not positive if it will be Uber; but hopefully we'd have options in due time); and it seems feasible for our current explorations. We'd love to have an option available for our initial launch! 4. We are still planning to have a grey color and are in the final stages of finessing the colorways. We will have a definite answer to colors soon. Thanks again for backing and can't wait to share the phone with you :)

Many thanks for your answers Joe and congratulations for the project! Can't wait to have my light phone II; I just got back to a flip phone but it lacks some of the basic tools for me..."
Hi Joe - A few questions:1) will there be a monthly fee for using the portal if we use our own carrier instead of using the Light plan?2) Will the calendar / contacts on the portal / phone support linking from other accounts (like a Gmail or Outlook or Office 365)? and if so - will it support multiple?  Personally I have Outlook and use Office 365 for work and would love to see support for both simultaneously.3) Can we set a do-not-disturb so phone calls or texts don't come in at night?,5 months ago,"4) Can we set VIP on contacts and maybe make those easier to dial? (and allow them to break through the do-not-disturb)5) Will the bluetooth be able to use headphones and link with speakers and maybe cars?6) Will there definitely be a headphone jack that will work with mic/headphone devices?

Hi Jonathan;1. Nope! 2. Contacts will have a few options; as well as a way to batch import a list of contacts say from Outlook for example. Calendar is not yet flushed out and won't be available by launch; but will likely work with a few external accounts be it Gmail; Outlook; iCal etc. 3. There are a few ways to control notifications and an easy way using the volume button to turn off all sounds/vibrations completely. It is not yet auto-schedule-able; but that's something we're exploring too..

4. Currently we don't have a VIP or Favorites; but it's also something we could explore. The way that OS is currently set up the main ""phone"" screen is a list of the recent contacts/threads and we are presuming that many of one's favorited VIP contacts would be on the first or second page of that list and very easy to access regularly for exactly this reason. We don't yet have individual notification settings; but it's an interesting idea  thanks! 5. Yep; that's the goal for bluetooth...

6. Headphone jack is a definite! It will work with mic handsets too."
Hi founders.  I hope it's going well.  I wanted to ask about a possible refund. Could you DM me?  It has nothing to do with the coolness of the product. Just more personal.,5 months ago,"Of course we can certainly offer you a refund. It's not possible to do directly through Indiegogo and we have been mostly using Paypal to do so. If you can please email us at support@thelightphone.com we can arrange the refund for you; thanks for understanding and for spending some time with our project. Hopefully our paths cross again.

thx Joe. Really appreciate it. Will contact the support email."
"hi Joe -My wife and I are looking forward to getting these phones!  I did want to note to you and others that one way people could extend the capabilities of the phone is to use IFTTT (go to ifttt.com) - a free service to link an ""if this"" event with a ""then that"" action.  The ""then"" can be an SMS message and the ""this"" can be a whole number of things.  This way you could get a text message on the LP2 from a service even though the phone doesn't natively support that service / app.",5 months ago,"For instance - want the weather update in the morning?  want an alert when a stock rises more than 5%?  You can do these and many; many more things via IFTTT.

Hi Jonathan; Thanks for sharing such a helpful tip. It's true; IFTTT is wonderful and we did some tests and for certain users with very specific needs it can open up a lot of functionality on the Light Phone II as you mention. This is exactly the type of community oriented comments we love; thanks for taking the time to share; can't wait to get you your Light Phones!"
Hi joe; I was wondering if it hasnt been mentioned by other backer yet cant remember or in the update. will you be supporting wifi calls like in the iPhone or any plans to support one. I think this is convenient when at home to save data on 3G/4G I always use it for calling at home. since the phone support wifi? Will it work on light phone,5 months ago,Hi Lorenzo; I will need to verify with the software team; but I don't think initially Wifi calling is supported.
Hi! Is it too late to ask for a refund? Im very excited about this phone; but might be living abroad; and realistically I dont think it would work bc I dont know how long Im going to be living there/ going back to my home country. And the phone only being in English is an issue. Sorry about that ; I really do love the phone.,5 months ago,Yes; of course; please email support@thelightphone.com and we can find a way to refund your pledge. Thanks again for the support and hope the move is as painless as it can be.
Hi Joe;Is 2FA support (e.g. Google Authenticator; Authy) on the roadmap for the team? I know that you can use SMS for 2FA; but in general it's not as secure. And in some cases; if Authenticator is enabled on any device; SMS will not be available. I'll be using my PC more when going light; and will want a smooth login experience without compromising security.Thanks!Mike,6 months ago,Hi Michael; 2FA is not in the immediate roadmap; but I can ask about it in our upcoming survey; thanks for reminding me because we'd like to know how many backers would find a 2FA solution very useful. Thanks for understanding!
Hi Joe; would you be able to share any details on packaging for LP2? I love what you all did with the original Light Phone. Happy new year!,6 months ago,Thanks; we really were proud of that packaging; so glad to hear that! As much as we want to surprise everyone with the packaging when the phone arrives at your door; I will share about our direction in the next update. At a high level the last packaging was highly conceptual and intended to be kept forever as a  way to encourage one to go light; this time we are making it more environmentally friendly and utilitarian in a way that the Light Phone II is; while still a special and light experience
Hi;Can't wait for April; it's all looking great so far.Just following on from what Paige McGrail suggested; would it be possible to do something like host WhatsApp on a virtual Android machine; then push and pop to the messaging interface on the phone? It would then keep the phone nice and simple.,6 months ago,Hi Chris; Thanks! That's an interesting idea; appreciate you taking the time to share. It certainly seems like a potential option for trying to integrate something like Whatsapp in a simple fashion for those interested. I know a few of our developers had high level ideas which I think were a little different; but we honestly haven't yet had the resources to devote to fully explore integrating messaging platform support. I've taken note of this though and will pass along; thanks! Hope all is well
So; I finally decided to order your phone today. Yay! I've been debating this for months; so I'm pretty confident it will be worth it for me. Here's my question: will there be a way to get local weather forecasts? I'm pretty sure I can get text alerts from the weather channel's site for that; but just curious if you guys had another option. Thanks for your effort into making the phone. It looks very promising.,6 months ago,Hi Crystle! Thanks so much for the support and can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you. We may explore some sort of weather tool as an future option; but weather was not the highest priority when we did our initial survey with everyone so it likely won't be available right away. I do love your idea for a hack though; I've spoken with other backers who will do similar things for their specific needs ('If This Than That is a great resource for things like that!). Thanks for understanding!
Hi. Posted this question via twitter too...given LP2 has WiFi Bluetooth and 4G - will it function as a WiFi hotspot? Major selling point for the Punkt MP02 and would mean a lot to a lot of users. CiaoPs Tidal for music would be coolPPs hope your 4G bands work in Australia cos I just preferred one!,6 months ago,Hi Eric; sorry for my slow response on Twitter; just saw that message a few minutes ago. Hot spot is certainly something we plan to offer; our only uncertainty is around the timing of when it will be available. FYI the bands for the international phone are: B1; B3; B5; B7; B8; B20; B28 incase you would like to verify that. Hope all is well!
Will the LP2 allow group texting?,6 months ago,Yep!
Can the LP2 be used as a hot spot?,6 months ago,We do also plan to offer a hotspot as an optional tool; as requested by many backers. We hope to have this available by our initial launch; but I cannot 100% confirm that just yet; although it likely will be there. Thanks!
Will the LP2 have a calendar that we can use and sync with other devices?,6 months ago,Calendar may come as an optional future tool; but it likely will not be available by our initial launch. I'm not sure the exact functionality of the calendar; but I imagine that it will certainly sync with other devices using the same calendar account. Thanks for understanding!
The latest Punkt phone says its compatible with Verizon but when we tried to activate the phone just days ago; Verizon says its not compatible. Our understanding is the phone is unlocked and uses the same technology Verizon uses; so it should be compatible; but Verizon says it wont work. Can you verify that Verizon is willing to allow us to use the LP2 on its network?,6 months ago,"Hmm; I'm not sure why that would be happening with the Punkt phone; but that sounds quite frustrating. I have not verified it with an actual Verizon SIM yet; so we will make sure to do that. We have not had any issues in the past with carriers like that. If you don't mind me asking; did you actually test it with a Verizon SIM or did someone at the store warn you that it wouldn't work? Perhaps because it's not sold at their stores they might just say that in hopes you'll buy from them?

Regardless; I have passed a note about this along to the team to make sure we can verify that prior to shipping everyone their phones!

We actually did test it with a Verizon SIM. Punkt informed us that they contacted Verizon and Verizon verified that their technology recently changed; this the latest 4G Punkt is not compatible. I know; a lot of he said; she said. Seeing as Verizon is the only reliable service where I live; Im hoping the LP2 is up to date with Verizons standards and is compatible. Thanks!

Thanks for the follow up; we will do some investigating on our side and get back to you. Hope all is well!"
Greetings! Cant wait for April and possibly February for the chance to be a Beta tester! These are exciting times. Ive read through many comments and havent found these answers; please forgive me if Ive missed something. Recently we purchased the latest Punkt phone while we wait for the LP2 and it helped work through a ton of thoughts and questions we have. So here goes... Will the phone have WiFi calling? Its helpful for those of us in rural America.,6 months ago,"Hi Julie; Thanks again for the support! I do not believe from the get go that the phone will support WiFi calling; but I will need to investigate it with the developers more to understand how it could work. Technically the phone should be capable of it; but the team is sprinting to get everything ready for beta testing; so I think for now it's safe to assume it will not have Wifi calling unfortunately. I appreciate you pointing this out to us; we will certainly want to learn more.

Thank you for your expediency and transparency in answering!"
is it a single or dual sim phone,6 months ago,Hello Kamlesh; Sorry for not making that more clear; but the Light Phone II takes a single Nano SIM (no dual slot). Hope that all is well!
I was also curious as to how many contacts the Light Phone 2 can store. I know the original can only have 9 which I'll admit could be quite inconvenient; will there be a limit for the Light Phone 2?,6 months ago,Great question; and sorry for not being more clear there. There is no limit currently of contacts you can store on the Light Phone II; other than perhaps the phone's hard drive space (8gb shared between everything). However; we really don't foresee that as a limitation. I don't have an estimate off the top of my head for how many contacts the phone could store hypothetically with that space but my guess would be well beyond what I imagine anyone would need on a Light Phone. Cheers.
Hi Guys! It must be so nice to be seeing your dream coming to fruition before your very eyes. Keep up the great work! Additionally; did another survey go out via email? You mentioned in your last update that your goal is to send out another survey before end of year - not sure if I missed it or if it did not go out yet. It is really neat how you have such an eager and willing pool of customers who are excited to share their input on your product. :),6 months ago,Thanks Ben and wishing you a happy new year! Yeah I didn't really think through the holiday schedule when I said that I realize; and now think it makes most sense to send the survey this week after the new year in hopes that we'll have a better response rate because a lot of people were away from their inboxes (hopefully) this past week.
Happy Holidays Joe! Would it be possible to add a Budget tool? User enters $ for budget. As they spend those dollars; they update the tool with how much they've spent. The tool shows a meter; like a battery meter; of how much $ they have left. I've been experimenting using cash. It really makes me think twice about what I need & what I want. One negative is losing a wallet w/ lots of $ in it. A $ meter could have the same effect as seeing a nearly empty wallet; but you could use a debit card.,6 months ago,Hi Edgardo; This may be something that is possible in the long run for the Light Phone II; we do hope to have a variety of tools for our specific user's needs. Because we are a small team we will be prioritizing the additional tools based off the feedback from our survey and general conversations with backers; and so for now there is not a plan to have a budget tool but I've taken note of the suggestion and appreciate you taking the time to share that idea. Hope all is well!
Hey! I've been following the project for quite some time and I finally decided to fully commit and back it! Super excited because this is exactly the type of phone I've been looking for and so far from what I've seen there's nothing quite like it.Just to confirm; is April 2019 still the projected delivery date? Are you still planning on meeting that or is a delay likely?,6 months ago,Hi Geoff; So glad to have you as a backer and thanks for spending time with our project; seriously means a lot. We are still on track as of today for April delivery. Not sure the exact date in the month and will keep everyone posted especially as we get to February & March as to our progress and timeline. There is still a possibility of delay; it's the nature of manufacturing; but we are trying everything in our power to avoid that at all costs.
Sanity check.  Emojis and MMS photos are definitely not needed.  I'm puzzled why backers are steering the Light Phone 2 toward being a baby smartphone.  Phone; text messaging; quality antennas and good battery life - that's all I need.,6 months ago,Cheers Oliver!
I just wanted to ask if there were any plans for the messages to be accessible through the web portal thats planned for set up of the phonesimilar to how the imessage app can be used on a mac computer. I have an iphone and just recently had to get a macbook for work and have found that the ability to access messages from my laptop makes it so I dont have to be checking my phone as much. if im already working on the computer; im not concerned about wanting to be offline from receiving messages.,6 months ago,Hi Paige; Great question. I also really enjoy texting via the computer; so I totally understand your question. At the moment we don't yet have it in our dev planning.  Our biggest concern is in making sure we maintain security and privacy of those messages; it's not an impossible challenge but one we have not had the time to deeply explore. April is our launch; but we plan to continue to improve the experience ongoing and I'd love to see an option for this as well! Thanks for suggestion
Hi Joe; hope you're having an excellent holiday break. Something has been nagging me about messaging with LP2: lack of any MMS preview and no emoji. I think forwarding to email for full resolution is a good solution but not offering any preview is going to add a lot of friction I feel. I don't need the preview to look good; just let me know what they sent and respond. Same with emoji. People send me pics and emoji all the time and I feel like the simplicity of going light...,6 months ago,"...shouldn't include explaining to everyone that I can no longer receive pics or emoji. I want the LP2 to be invisible on their end as much as possible. Honestly; this is a pretty essential part of it for me. If I have to field questions all day long about why I'm using a phone in 2019 that can't even receive pics or emoji; it's going to become more a hassle than a benefit. I've owned a lot of niche weird products so I'm no stranger to...

...explaining the benefits and dealing with constant questioning but I'm just not eager to do that here. My iPhone SE already gets a little flak. Anyway; that's my pitch for why LP2 should at least give me a rough preview of media even if it doesn't look good (otherwise what do I even reply with??) and display emoji. I don't even need to send emoji (it'd be nice) just at least receive it when people send it. I love LP2's philosophy but I don't think adding these compromises it; it actually helps

Hi Thomas; Thanks so much for the heartfelt and thorough feedback; it's genuinely appreciated. I do see your point. Over the past few weeks we did some emoji testing and it seems that we can offer users the option to receive emojis; albeit in black and white of course. We also explored translating the emojis to text i.e. ""*yellow_heart*"" or something like that. We do want to have the option to disable emojis completely of course. Thanks for bringing up the MMS point as well...

...Currently we are still planning to only show a notification that an image was sent. I can see your point about the context and confusion that can arise; but Im also concerned about the complications that might arise in trying to allow some sort of preview image especially when it comes to .gifs or videos which will really not play well at all on the Light Phones E-ink screen...

...Im curious to know how everyone feels about previewing an image so thank you for pointing this out. I'll include a question about this in the upcoming survey expected later this week. Looking forward and thanks again Thomas. Happy new year!"
I selected 1 black and 1 white.  Is it too late to change the color options?,6 months ago,Hi Aram; Nope not a problem at all; in fact we will be confirming the color options and shipping address with everyone prior to shipping the phones. At that time we will have lots of photos and videos of the final units to show the different colors so making the decision will be a little easier. Hope all is well!
Please be clear about the planning; when will the units ship? You agreed to the Terms of Use of the Indiegogo site/system. I see only a few answers to question from backers.,6 months ago,"Hello; Sorry for any confusion. The plan is still to deliver the Light Phone II in April. As of today we are still on track for that goal and we will certainly and quickly let everyone know if that changes. I do not know the exact date yet of when our backers can expect their phones to arrive to their doorsteps; and seeing as we have backers all over the world it will be a little different for everyone. We plan to ship the phones with tracking and in the coming months  keep everyone posted.

Please let me know if you have any other questions; we're trying our best to answer all of the comments on our page as quickly as possible; but we are a relatively small team so thank you for understanding. Hope that all is well!"
I agree with Kenneth Schlatter so much! For a future app update; Signal would surely make a good figure as a messenger on your phone; even so with an open source code.,6 months ago,Appreciate the feedback. I also love Signal. I replied to Kenneth below but in general our initial study in talking with them was a little intimidating in terms of how much work it would take to make it compatible. Perhaps there was some misunderstanding and once we are ready we plan to follow up and dive into their github code to see what's possible. Our focus through the beta testing is to make sure the core OS is bullet proof; Signal likely won't be available by initial launch to be honest.
"Now that the FCC has reclassified SMS and MMS as Information Services"" under Title I (as opposed to ""Commination Services"" under Title II); I believe it is even more important to offer a secure alternative. In this situation; I think the best option is Signal. It's completely opensource. Here's the code for their Android app: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android",6 months ago,Totally agree and would love to offer something like Signal. I'm a user myself and we've already opened up communication with their founder but he was honestly pretty hesitant about the amount of work it would take to make (and maintain)compatibility with Light Phone II. He estimated a dedicated team larger than our entire current team. We have not given up by any means and we will explore it again with our developers when we are done with our current priority of finishing the basic OS.
no questions; no doubts; just pure excitement for your final product. i imagined and sketched something like a light phone 2 a few years ago and am absolutely blessed that you've been given the knowledge and energy to manifest it. keep doing god's work!!,6 months ago,Cheers Joseph; looking forward to 2019 and sharing the Light Phone II with all our backers!
Google Fi recently opened up it's network hopping service to phones beyond the Google family of products. Is there an opportunity that The Light Phone 2 will take advantage of this option?,6 months ago,"The good news is our antenna bands are compatible with Google Fi; but I'm not very familiar with exactly what the Google Fi criteria is (if any) for working with phones beyond their service. I'm not sure if there needs to be some sort of ""Google Fi"" app on the phone itself? We'd love our users to have more options for service providers so I do hope it is able to work with their service offerings. Thanks for understanding!"
For the people outside US (we dont have free SMS or MMS) we would love to have some messaging options. Telegram would be the perfect app to be implemented in the Light Phone 2 as it has an open API that can be tweaked and tailored for this wonderful device. An option for silent notifications would also be nice.Please; consider this or other options with open source apps because it would be awesome for those poor little guys who have to pay per each SMS (its criminal; I know),6 months ago,Totally understand where you're coming from. We'd love to be able to offer some options for free international (internet based) messaging. Until we complete the initial OS and have everything up and running we won't be able to explore the future additional tools like this; so as much as I'd love to promise something like Telegram; I don't have any idea when it may be available yet; just want to be honest there. Our team is often spread internationally and we do really understand your point.
Also; (sorry for the barrage of comments today) will there be a slot for expanding storage space (i.e. for more music)? I currently keep my music on an external micro SD card that just pops into whatever phone i want to use.,6 months ago,Hi Ben; There is no micro SD slot on the Light Phone II.
Will there be a speakerphone feature when on a call?,6 months ago,Yep we are planning to have a speakerphone option during calls.
+1 to Conor Daly's comment,6 months ago,
Hey joe; would it be possible to have all calendar entries lined up in a list? Event titles would be like contact names; and details could be paginated. Having the calendar sync to the web portal would also be helpful (having text and contact backed up into the portal would be nice as well). One of the nice things about a calendar app is that you can simply click the address of the event; and go straight to your navigation/directions app. This way we can all stay on schedule while going light :),6 months ago,Those are definitely interesting ideas for a calendar tool; thanks for taking the time to share them. I will be honest that we have not really begun to explore additional tools like the calendar just yet so I'm not yet sure what the final functionality will be yet; thanks for understanding.
Hi; I have a question regarding the messaging interface.  Given that the core operating system is Android and the sensors in the glass stack; has there been a discussion about incorporating swipe typing into the keyboard?  I've grown to really like it since switching from iPhone.  It would be great to see it Incorporated in the light phone II,6 months ago,"Hi Connor; Thanks for the suggestion. Not personally familiar with swipe but have heard good things from others as well. I'm not sure swipe would work well with the e-ink because the refresh rate of the screen would feel lagging relative to the swipe gestures. The touch screen on the Light Phone II is totally capable; but with a slow visual feedback it may be confusing to use. Hope that makes sense and thanks for understanding!

Totally understand the limitations of the screen refresh rate. For me personally; the animation associated with the swiping is arbitrary as long as the letters of the keyboard are visible. Since the stack can handle the input; it would ideally only require one refresh per word once your finger is lifted from the keyboard. I think it could be good in theory; but just wanted to put it out there. I appreciate all the hard work that's going into this project; it's looking great!"
Hullo! I'm so excited for Light Phone 2! I was wondering - is the music flow going to be to control downloaded music; or services like Apple Music; Spotify? If so; which services? I'm wondering if I'd be able to use Spotify with this.Thank you!!,6 months ago,Hi Rishi; Ideally we'd have a few options in due time. I imagine we'd have an optional tool for streaming a Spotify playlist (and other platforms would have their own optional tool too; seems unlikely that Apple Music would allow it though) as well as a 'music player' tool that allowed you to upload songs directly to the device. We realize that our different backers will have different needs so hopefully we can have options for everyone. Not sure yet what will be available by launch. Thanks!
Hello. Have you considered adding a way to switch off the clock from the settings?,6 months ago,Yep! It's actually already included as an option in the settings we're building out now and something we also offered on the original Light Phone as well. It's a little more niche of a setting so we haven't mentioned it in any update as far as I recall. We think it's an awesome option to have and I'm glad someone asked about it; cheers
Hi; I have a query on the phone service plans and usage. I'm from Chennai; India and the service providers available here are different from the regular AT&T and Verizon. This being an unlocked phone; I will still be able to use it with the local service provider SIM available in India right?,6 months ago,"Yep that is correct and I apologize for any confusion there. The phone is completely unlocked and that is how most of our users will likely use the device. Our service plans are completely optional. Hope that all is well.

Thank you for the clarification; that helps."
Hey; i noticed your comment about phone plans in the last update- sounds like this will not be compatable with any carrier? Up here in Montana; Verizon is the only realistic option for decently reliable service.,6 months ago,Sorry for any confusion there; the phone is still an unlocked phone that you can use with the SIM of your choice. The plan is completely optional and just an attempt to simplify the experience for interested users. Thanks for pointing that incase anyone else was confused; I'll be more explicit next time.
Thanks Light Phone Team for the really fast responses to backer comments!  I'm sure it's a lot to look after but the frequency of your replies and your openness to suggestions is much appreciated!  I did have one thought regarding the phone plans.  Here in the US we use Ting for our service.  They offer both GSM and CDMA SIM cards and are very affordable.  I don't work for them but plan to use them when my Light Phone 2 arrives.  They may be worth considering as your service provider partner,6 months ago,Hey Oliver; thanks for the great suggestion. We are quite familiar with Ting; and they were actually our partner for our SIMs in the original Light Phone. I think they have some great offerings for our backers of Light Phone II as well; even though they aren't going to be our partner for the Light II SIMs. Cheers
"On the notification front; I find one universal notification cumbersome (engenders unlock checking of the whole phone); so would favour a solution of either customisable icons/characters per app; or pre-assigned icons/characters (SMS = *; Email = @; etc.). In any case; a master ""no notifications"" switch is a must.",6 months ago,Appreciate the feedback! I do see your point because it's totally true that on smartphones a pointless notification can lead you into a 10 minute scroll hole. Fortunately having no holes to get lost in on the Light Phone II is our goal. It may be possible to have a variety of icons as you suggest; although we honestly don't imagine there being notifications other than SMS/Missed Calls . The future tools I imagine won't have push notifications. Hope that makes sense and thanks again
Just my tuppence in the conversation. Overall; I'm really enjoying the direction and evolution of the LP2. A shame about USB-C; but understandable. On the alarm topic; I'd personally prefer two alarms; and a day of the week schedule for each (i.e. enabling a week and weekend alarm); plus multiple timers (potatoes into the oven in 35mins; carrots in 55mins. Vegetable labels optional).,6 months ago,That all makes sense to me; and I can see where you are coming from. Thanks for the taking the time to share; we'll be exploring some things with the alarm based off everyone's feedback. We don't want to lose it's simplicity of course; but we do want it to be useful.
Hi Joe;You mentioned there might be some phone plans offered with the Light Phone 2. Would the plans be available year round so that one can switch at any point; or would the plans be tied to the phone delivery date?Thank you.D,6 months ago,Great question. We plan to have the plan available as an option for existing users as well; meaning that you would not need to sign up at the time of delivery date and we could send a SIM at any point.
Hello! I am really looking forward to my Light Phone 2. I wanted to ask if there is any possibility of integrating Signal (or perhaps some other secure form of messaging) with the Light Phone 2--privacy is one of the reasons I wanted to move away from a smartphone. Thanks for all your hard work!,6 months ago,Hey Jonathan; I also love Signal and totally understand where you are coming from. I'd love to have an encrypted messaging option; but from our super early high level explorations with the Signal team; they were weary of how difficult it might be to implement. We have not given up on the idea and hope to explore it and have a future option available. I think it's safe to assume it won't be possible for initial launch. Thanks for understanding!
It looks like I'm relocating to Iceland from the US. Is there a hardware difference in the model I'll need? Can I update that in my pledge somehow?,6 months ago,Hi James; not sure off the top of my head if Iceland uses the same model as US or not; but regardless we will be following up to confirm everyone's shipping address and provide a simple compatibility checker tool (website) to confirm the model that everyone would like prior to shipping this April. Iceland sounds like a nice change of pace; good luck with the move!
Hey;Is the plan for this phone to have a open back; an accessible battery for ease of replacement or removal for ultimate do not disturb or is the current plan to leave it closed back and unable to get to battery without sending it back?,6 months ago,"Unfortunately it does not have an an easily remove-able back ; although I completely see your point. I believe the team's concern with a remove-able back was increasing size. I'm pretty sure the battery is also customized as well; which would also make it hard to replace on one's own. It is likely that replacing the battery would require sending the phone back. Sorry to not have better news there.

While this news is not great. My opinion of the overall phone is quite high. I cannot wait to switch; I grow weary of my smart phone and all of the distractions that come along with it. Thank you for your response and well wishes moving forward with the project!"
Hi folks. Excited for this device. Request about MMS - how will group MMS look in the UI? Specifically: how will we be able to see who's in what thread? When there are more than 2 other people on an MMS convo; it's really helpful to be able to rename the convo (I do this in Textra on my S8) so I can see at a glance which conversation is which. The difference between a MMS convo of Peer; Peer; Peer; and one that contains Peer; Peer; Peer; and Boss is an important one...,6 months ago,"Hey! Great question. By default the group threads will have the list of participants as the name; but we are aware how awkward that is; especially with our smaller screen limitation so we've made it really simple to name the thread. If you were in the conversation; click the list of names at the top (the default name) to open up the ""edit contact""; currently you have the option to give the thread a name; see all participants; mute the thread or leave the conversation . Hope that makes sense!

That's awesome. Even better. Thanks Joe!"
1.) Recent update: Beaut.2.) A question:. Since the summer I've downgraded my data to 500MB (only for talk and text; with some MMS sprinkled in). You've noted some of the features of the LP2 will be pushed OTA or server-routed. Is there any reason for someone with a cap this low should be concerned?,6 months ago,Great question. The OTA updates would not need to be very frequent or large in data; but it's a valid concern. There is always the option to do such updates while in wifi as to not deplete your data with updates; so that could be a good alternative. Hope that makes sense!
What Ben Y. said about any MMS messages being forwarded to our e-mail would be really awesome.  Looking forward to recieving this phone.,6 months ago,Cheers; and agree; it's an idea we have on the back burner to explore for sure. Appreciate the feedback!
Hi Joe; not sure if this was mentioned before but maybe we could arrange for mms messages to be forwarded to our email addresses?,6 months ago,It's an idea we have on the back burner to explore; glad it makes sense to others too. Cheers
Hey Joe; would it be possible for the lock screen to show a pause/play; skip back; and skip forward buttons when audio is playing? This would show when the screen is turned on; but the phone is not yet unlocked.,6 months ago,We honestly have not yet designed out the flow for playing music as we're still just focused on the core OS and don't have a music tool built yet; but I agree that when we do it will be really important to make that as seamless of an experience as possible. The play/pause/skip buttons on lock screen may end up being the solution for sure; but at this time it's to be explored still; thanks for understanding!
Looks great and I cant wait to get mine in April! Couple of questions for you; and maybe Im getting ahead of things a bit; but wanted to ask anyways. Will you provide some sort of warranty with the phones? Also I know a possible case for the phone down the road has been mentioned; but if something breaks (or I drop my phone); will I be able to send it in for repairs?Thanks and keep up the great work!,6 months ago,"Personally Id prefer the phone without a case because it looks absolutely fantastic; but having broken an iPhone in the past (who hasnt?); Im just curious about all of my options. Thanks again!

Hi Isaac; thanks! As for warranty; we don't have that finalized yet; but we want to be as fair as possible especially to our early backers who supported us. We've always taken full responsibility for any defective devices and given our users the benefit of the doubt. If the phone broke because of an accident; say a big drop; we offered a discount (at cost) for a replacement and/or repair depending. I hope to have a similar offering for Light Phone II...

As for case; we do plan to have at least one optional case available by the time we launch that will protect the phone.  The phone is definitely really nice without the case. Since the case isn't ready I can't comment on how it feels with the case; but as with any phone with glass screens there is a risk in not using a case. Thanks for understanding!

Seems more than fair. As a said; Id rather use the phone without the case and  after reading your reply; I will probably do just that. Thanks for the clarification and keep up the amazing work!"
Hi Joe; one of the things that made the LP1 look so great was that in standby it looked like a plastic card with a uniform frosted/matte front. When the backlit characters appeared; they were a surprise as there was no visible screen.  Can you do the same with the LP2? Maybe have a very light frosting across the full screen so that the entire front looks the same when the phone is in standby.  Then the e-ink screen could show under the very light frosting. Just a thought!,6 months ago,"I know you did cover this in an update; but just wondering if a very light frosting might work.  If not; could you use a graduated frosting to blur the bezel-screen borders? Either way; it looks great and cant wait to go light in April.

Hi Richard; Thanks for the feedback and suggestion. We know exactly what you mean; the original Light Phone was a 'magic trick' to us how it magically lit up from a blank screen. Unfortunately at a high level; it's not really possible. The E-ink screen is unique in that it has no back light; so the screen would not be able to appear through the painted glass. We tried to explain it more detailed in this blog post: https://medium.com/the-light-phone/why-a-screen-eca598f37159  ... thanks!"
Also; would just like to add; after reading the front page story in the Times this morning; I'm more eager than ever to have this device in my hands !,6 months ago,Oh yeah; a few friends just sent that to me this morning too. Pretty scary stuff...
Wonderful update! Question: would it be possible to visit the studio in Navy Yard with my two friends who are also supporters? I live in Fort Greene and they're visiting from Berlin. We are giant apologists and evangelists for the project; and; if possible; would love to swing by the studio to express our gratitude and maybe see what's going on. Thanks !,6 months ago,emailed you back :)
So happy to have the update; thanks very much! I really like the simple; single alarm; so I'd like to be a voice in support of that. Interface looks much easier than my current smart phone's version of the alarm; so nice work; thanks. Slightly thicker doesn't bother me at all; just hoping the development doesn't lean towards a smartphone-sans-internet; agreeing with another commenter who mentioned that. I'm so looking forward to modeling non-smart-device phone use for my kids. Thanks again!,6 months ago,Thanks for the support and encouragement Alice. Also very much looking forward to April!
Hey team! Thanks for the new update; very excited. It's looking like its all coming together nicely. Could their be an option to swap the clock on the home/lock screen from a digital to a minimal analog clock?,6 months ago,Love this idea; it's something we do want to offer as an option; but it's not certain if it will be available in the very first software version because we haven't explored it aside from design sketches. Glad others are interested in that idea though! (it was going to be a question for the next survey actually) Cheers
Joe and Team: thanks for the December update. Really appreciate all the details; especially regarding the screen / film colour-matching and shadow mitigation. I think that photos from the last update threw some people off; they not realizing the pics were MOCKUPS and in no way intended to represent the final product. Their loss for backing out. PS - I love that you're working on an unlimited phone plan! Unexpected; but very welcome. Quick question tho: will the plan be available in Canada?,6 months ago,"Thanks Ross. The process is not always pretty at every step; that's for sure; and I think I could have done a better job and explaining the context of those mock up in the larger process. As for the plan; I think in the short term at least; the plan is going to be limited to the US unfortunately. Maybe we can compile a resource of reasonable Light Phone appropriate plans with carriers outside the US.

That would be v. cool. There are only a handful of carriers in Canada with their associated flank brands (in parentheses):- Bell (Virgin)- Rogers (Fido)- Telus (Koodo)They are anti-competitive however. When Verizon tried to enter the CDN market; these three thugs successfully lobbied to squash the deal.Anyway; keep on keeping on. It's been worth the price of admission just to see the ideation and prototyping play out over time! (I'm involved in product mgmt; so this is all v. awesome)"
Hey Joe;Thanks for posting the most recent update! I really feel like an active participant in the development of the LP2; and the transparency is really nice.A very simple test to see if another language (i.e. Hebrew in this example) are readable by the LP2 would be to text the word  (Hello) from a different phone to the LP2. I tried this with a different simple phone that is also running a scaled down version of android and it worked great. Id love to know what happens with this test!,6 months ago,That's a good idea for a test; will mention it to the team and get back you! I have a feeling it should also work well; but I do want to double check that sooner than later.
So a few updates ago you mentioned eventually asking the community for people who would be interested in beta testing this phone. Is that still going to happen? If so; when?,6 months ago,Hey Kenneth; That's right we are still planning to have the Beta at some point around the Chinese New Year in February. Prior; most likely January; we'll ask for interested users and depending how many backers are interested and phones available we will likely do a lottery pool to select the beta testers. Hope all is well
"Joe; fantastic work here by the Light Team. Please add the option of selecting the days of the week for the Alarm and default only set for one day (depending on time of day; that day or next day). I've woken up many Saturday mornings by default alarms set for the whole week or that I have to remember to turn off... A customizable ""Vacation"" mode would be cool too; no Alarms; notifications set to nothing; automatic away message saying ""Don't bother me. I'm drinking Margaritas by the beach.""; etc.",6 months ago,"Hey Edgardo! Thanks for the feedback. Really happy you mention wanting the ""vacation"" mode with away messages; that's also something I'd really like to introduce in the phone. Away messages (from AIM days) was actually a huge inspiration to our initial Light Phone; we thought of it as a modern away message to your smartphone. An ode to a time when the internet didn't live in our pockets but was more clearly limited to a desktop or such. Cheers!"
As a software engineer; my main concern is the custom OS. I know how hard it is to build a solid web app; let alone an entire OS. Will the OS have updates and upgrades? If huge bugs crop up; are we just going to be stuck with the bugs?If possible; it would be fantastic if there was an SDK so people could add functionality. I totally get you are a small scrappy team and I think that's awesome! Opening the door for others to create apps or add functionality could really offload a lof work.,6 months ago,Hi Steven; Completely valid concerns around the OS. I'm happy to report that we will have a very seamless update mechanism; it was actually one of the first pieces we built. The SDK is also something we'd love to introduce too. At this time; we don't have a lot of details as our focus is just getting the core OS running smoothly and bug-free; but in due time we do plan to release an SDK to share with the community. Eager to see what people will make!
Also the alarm setting definitely different to what Im used to but always encouraged to try something new. make sense to use keypad to enter time and hours. overall look forward to see more update and mock-up photos as well for core features update,6 months ago,Cheers!
Finally the update is out ? nice to see improvement to the screen looking amazing; update symbol (*) seem simple enough than icon notifications we get on smartphone. but we wont know which it for until we open the phone to view the notifications. Having scroll bar for contact list is easier than using the side button to go up and down which is ideal and perfect including messages especially when you have long list of info. what is the box thing in contact list next to searchbar?,6 months ago,"Thanks for the feedback Lorenzo.  Those two ""box things"" are just place holder icons at the moment. One will represent opening the dial pad; to dial a new number not in one's contacts either to call or add to contacts; and the other button is to compose a new message/group message. Those exact icons are what we are playing with currently; sorry for the confusion there!"
Have to agree with Bradley. Without meaning to offend anyone; when did we all become so wimpy about an ounce here or there on our devices? Especially for the LP2; which is designed to be used sparingly; who cares if it's a tiny bit thicker or heavier? The more important things are battery life and build quality; which are often compromised by manufacturers in the name of making a device thinner and lighter.,6 months ago,Cheers; Nicolaos!
LP2 is 1.05 millimeters thicker than an iPhone XS. I think this phone is perceived thicker than it is because of its reduced height and width.,6 months ago,That's actually a great point I hadn't really considered. It might be perceived as thicker in these photos because it's such a small phone. I was a little surprised by how the thickness was so troublesome because in the hand and pocket it still feels great to us. I do of course understand it's not as ridiculously thin as our original Light Phone; but we aren't willing to make the same usability tradeoffs again. Hope all is well!
"For the sake of ""balancing"" the conversation a little bit I'd just like to say that I'm actually looking forward to having a thick phone. All the big manufactuers are going thinner and thinner; but who's to say a thicker phone can't be amazing too? Isn't it the integrity; personality and honesty of an object that makes it appealing? (Not just the thin-ness.) Plus we'll get more battery; etc.Just some unsolicited thoughts. Thanks for the latest update!",6 months ago,Appreciate the unsolicited thoughts; Alex :) I wouldn't go as far as saying we aspired to make a thick phone haha; but I do agree that things like the E-Ink screen will give it a personality and unique to the Light Phone II. Cheers
"I know there will be mixed reviews on this; but I'd just like to applaud the single alarm. My hope is that you guys don't lose sight of going LIGHT and wind up creating a smart phone sans a web browser and app store. I think a lot of us truly want a simple device. Some people might be better off sticking with their smart phones; and that's okay. Trust your instincts and that of your team. Keep being brave enough to bring change. Be a LIGHT- ""The tech company that doesn't hijack your life.""",6 months ago,Just realized I never thanked you for this comment last month; John (was just now browsing through feedback of comments). Sincerely appreciate your understanding of our goal to keep the phone simple as possible!
For the alarm; I think a checkmark in the bottom left may make more sense. Also a second page for repeat options would be helpful. I would appreciate not having to turn it off on the weekends.,6 months ago,"Great feedback. Currently the repeat options are in the settings; but maybe it makes more sense in the tool itself. By default we imagined the alarm would not repeat; and would be manually set; but we'd have the option to repeat ""every weekday"" and option to repeat ""everyday"". Open to any ideas you have around repeat options though (I don't personally use scheduled alarms so hard for me to know what makes most sense for everyone)."
"Hi.  I noticed that the ""front page"" of the campaign still indicates that the device will be chargeable with USB-C.This gives me hope that you still think it may be possible to fit it in.  Is that still possible?  If there are any other trade-offs available; like making the device larger or more expensive; DO THAT.I'm a strong supporter of this project and I do not want to explain this project to friends as a ""Phone without USB-C but... it has some great other  features that are unique"".",6 months ago,"Sorry for any confusion Micah. It is a locked decision that it will have Micro-USB at this point. I have not touched the main campaign page as to not seem like we were being sketchy and ""editing"" our initial promises honestly. Maybe there is a way for me to update campaign page in a way that shows the original spec referenced to reflect what we projected vs our final outcome. If this is a deal breaker; we can of course offer you a refund if you email support@thelightphone.com...

I do not want a refund; because I want this project to succeed to the light-phone-3 (which will have a USB-C port) :)

The trade off was exactly that; it would have made the phone larger; not necessarily a cost issue. It may have been possible for us to make that swap perhaps over the summer; but to attempt to do so now would seriously compromise our schedule. We understand that everyone has a different opinion on whether that was the right or wrong decision; and I certainly wish it could have been USB-C too. Ultimately; we made the decision we thought made the most sense for the phone; thanks for understanding.

Thanks for understanding; Micah; very excited to still have you as a backer! I only say that about the refund because I do understand we did not live up to our promise on that front and don't want you to feel stuck with a device you no longer want. I completely agree that it is the more future-proof port. Aesthetically it is better and in usability it is better; but with no technical advantages and already feeling pressure about the size of the phone that was the decision that was made as a team"
Thanks for the update.  Quick question - can you disable the activity notification asterisk on the lock screen?  I prefer to check manually when I want to interact with the phone.  You're doing great work!,6 months ago,That's a good idea I had not considered; Oliver; thanks for posting; noted. Shouldn't be hard to add that as an option to the settings. Just to be clear currently the phone is blank while on standby; and when you wake the device is when you would see the lock screen with the indicator that there is something new. Regardless we want users to have more control than less of all things notifications; so that seems like a nice touch. Cheers!
Simplicity is great. A single alarm is not.,6 months ago,"Appreciate the feedback; Dave; I'm curious to learn more about that if you wouldn't mind elaborating on why a single alarm is not great for you. We shared it on the update hoping to get feedback so it is genuinely appreciated. We felt pretty strongly that one alarm made the most sense for a Light Phone; but it's not set in stone. Maybe the UX sketch isn't clear; you can always change the time of the alarm; it's just only one alarm at a time currently. Thanks!

Trivial examples:* Three things on the stove with different end times.* Parking meter in 3 hrs; hard stop in 4 hrs.Currently using Apple Watch for these things; I often have 2-4 alarms/timers active; offloading cognitive overhead (simplify my head) to a (relatively) complex device with a simple interface (""Set timer for three hours"").That is something I would miss; even conceding making GUIs ""simple"" is a lot harder UX challenge than throwing voice at something :/

Sorry for the formatting; IG isn't great at comments. You can reach out to me directly if you wish; big G at davelnewton. I have a lot of opinions on UX and design ;)

Thanks Dave; appreciate the thorough follow up. IG comments definitely not ideal and the formatting (lack there of) is annoying. I've thought about timers too (cooking/laundry etc.); and almost feel like it might be worth a separate tool? They are sort of different than an alarm in that you'd want to say ""set for three hours"" rather than calculating when three hours ahead is. I'll keep thinking about this too; thanks for the great feedback. My email is joe - at - thelightphone.com fyi."
I would love to hear more about the open API you mentioned.  I see some great possibilities here for useful; but simple; apps.,6 months ago,We don't have a lot of concrete details at this stage to share honestly. Our entire focus right now is on getting the MVP of the OS ready so we can start testing it out asap. I totally agree about seeing great possibilities for our backers and users to create useful tools for themselves. If there are any specific requests and/or concerns that you have about it we're certainly always open ears for feedback and suggestions. Thanks; Rocky!
Sooooo the new update is out and man im thrilled to see how its shaping up so far. The mockups look really great and the overall UI is amazingly attractor with its minimalism. Every-time I see an update I feel proud to have invested in this Phone. As for the thickness concerned in my earlier comment; not much of a deal as it has a jack! :-) Just Bring this phone already guys!!! ;-),6 months ago,Thanks; Ali! Really glad you like the update!
Hey Joe; Kaiwei and the rest of the team; I just perked a Light Phone 2 and am looking forward excitedly to seeing you progress and reach more people! I feel like me and many others owe you a big THANK YOU! Caught up in a world full of smartphones; I have come to realize that a lot of people's time is spent inside a portal into another world; whilst people think they're having fun; they miss precious time they could be spending with family; real friends and actual livingGood work! keep going!,6 months ago,Well said; Jonathan and super grateful for your support! Eager to share the Light Phone II with you :) Hope all is well.
Hey Joe and Kaiwei;I bought the couples set for me and my wife. Shes Chinese and has a lot of Chinese clients; so I was wondering if the phone have the option to select a Chinese/Pinyin keyboard for messaging?Thanks,6 months ago,"Nevermind; I just saw your reply to Yunju Hwang. I still think its a feature you would benefit from incorporating in the future; especially with China being a huge potential market.

Hi Joaquin; We completely see where you are coming from and do agree! Our concern is only about trying to be realistic in our user expectations because we are a small team right now. We felt it was too ambitious to promise language support at this stage; but it is something we would love to achieve one day; and we think it crucial to making this phone more usable globally. Thanks for the feedback! I imagine we would work with local designers to ensure a proper implementation of other languages."
Hi joe; seeing your response to Ali Fakhruddin I was thinking would removing head phone jack slim the phone thickness to as close as the original light phone. most smartphone dont have one to use Bluetooth wireless headphone and make phone thinner. I use Bluetooth on my iPhone for music. head phone jack isnt important as long it can make the phone thinner.,6 months ago,I believe you are correct and if we removed the head phone jack it could help us make the phone a little bit thinner. Probably not as thin as the original Light Phone though. However; adding a headphone jack was one of the biggest feedbacks we heard from the original Light Phone users (as well as bigger battery) and we feel that although the bluetooth option is there and welcome; it is important for many of our users to also have the headphone jack as well. Thanks for understanding!
Dear Joe;I was looking at the pictures of the prototype in the September update and noticed the thickness of the phone which concerned me. So; will the phone be that thick; or thin and minimal as we saw in the earlier videos and pictures?,6 months ago,Hi Ali; The photos in the recent update are representative of the final dimensions; not much is possible to change at this stage. Having been living with the form factor in my pockets for many weeks now; I am really enjoying it personally. It is not as thin as the original 2G Light Phone; sure; but that did not have 4G antennas; sufficient battery; e-ink or a headphone jack. We learned a lot from our user's feedback and are excited by the current direction.  Thanks for understanding!
Just wanted to say that this September update was perfect.I really appreciate the time you took expressing the vision and progress; I understand how challenging it can be to transfer the world you are creating into a story people can relate to.The additions of a web interface really resonate with me. It feels very considered and makes me feel like you are making decisions from the user's perspective.Can't wait to live light.,6 months ago,Cheers; Kristofer; that really means a lot to hear; thank you. Can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you sooner than later :)
Hi JoeI am worried about the phone is available to write in korean and see the korean  or not.,6 months ago,Hi Yunju;  Unfortunately by our initial launch we are only able to promise support for english characters. We obviously understand how important localization will be for our many international users but as a super small team it may not be possible for us to achieve that by April. If this makes the phone no longer usable for you and you'd like to request a refund we understand and can help with that if you email support@thelightphone.com. Thank you for understanding!
Hi Joe;I'm just curious about when the next update is!Coincidentally; my smartphone has begin to malfunction more and more... I'm so excited to go light in April!,7 months ago,"Hey Sarah! So sorry it's taking me forever to get this last update out. Definitely will have something for October/November update by end of the week! Hope all is well and eager you to get everyone the Light Phone II :)

* Hope all is well! Eager to get everyone their Light Phone II :)"
I know there isn't plans for emoji support currently; but is it a possibility for a future update that adds emoji? It's kind of an important part of communication for a lot of people now.,7 months ago,Hi Travis; After launching the phone there is a lot of room to update the phone; especially upon receiving feedback from everyone using the phone. So yes; I believe it should be possible to support Emoji in a future update if we think it makes sense and our users agree. Naturally the emojis on smartphones have colors that would not translate; so we'd have to really think about the cleanest (& universally compatible) way of trying to implement it. That's my biggest concern around emojis.
Joe--first off; these updates are great and your back and forth with all of us is really generous and appreciated. Please keep us posted on the likely delivery schedule--amazingly; we've kept our teenage and near-teenage kids from getting phones but that window of sanity is starting to close; so knowing when you folks are shipping might be useful in terms of getting them Light vs. app suffocated. Thanks!,7 months ago,Hi Geoffrey; thanks! We will certainly keep everyone updated regarding timeline; especially as we get into the new year and closer to shipping. We are still on track to deliver the phones in the month of April; but the precise time you can expect it to arrive at your door is still to be determined. Hope all is well and good luck in the mean time!
HelloI backed this project on the promise of USB-C (I only buy USB-C products). And I also think the Design is a bit far from the one in the Promotional videos. Is it possible to get a refund?I have to say I still love the idea and how you handle this campaign. Keep up the good work.Greetings from SwitzerlandMarc,7 months ago,Of course; and thanks for the kind words and support. If you please email support@thelightphone.com; we can help you refund your pledge. Best; Joe.
Interesting to see your choice of going from  USB C to micro. Most of the phone industry is also struggling with the space problem; but the more common approach has been to remove the headphone jack. Here's a poll comparing these two options (https://eve.community/t/poll-headphone-jack/16391/15?u=skimaster). While the sample size is small; users seem to be split about 50/50 on which approach is better.,7 months ago,Thanks for sharing that poll; Nicolaos. It wasn't an easy decision to make; and I can certainly relate to some backer's disappointment. Lack of a headphone jack was a very common critique of the original Light Phone and so that felt like a must-have to us. Although USB-C was our goal; Micro still feels relevant today (personally way more of my gadgets/gear use Micro). Realizing that our phone could not take advantage of the speeds of USB-C; also made Micro seem less severe of a tradeoff. Cheers
Hey Joe; will this phone support emoji? Even just a basic set of them would be fine. Currently I'm using one of the re-released Nokia 3310's; and whenever someone sends me a text with emoji's in it; all I see is squares; which is not ideal.Thanks for all your hard work on this phone - I'm looking forward to it!,7 months ago,"Hey! Hope all is well. I also tried using the 3310 for a few weeks; and I totally know what you mean. I'm not even really a fan of using emojis myself but not seeing anything but boxes is annoying for sure. I'm going to see what is possible here and get back to everyone. While we don't plan to support emojis for sending messages; maybe there is a way for us to translate them when received either into text (something like: *smiley face*) or into a basic set as you describe that we would create.

Hi Joe;Thanks. Yeah I'm not a fan of emoji's either; but most people just seem to love them! Thanks for your reply; I look forward to whatever you come up with."
Hi Joe; pretty bummed because I just read that you switched from the to-be standard USB-c to micro-USB; a standard which is already declared dead by most vendors. I do understand that you wanna keep the size as proposed but would still prefer the convenience of having a more common connectivity by the time the product is released over it. Maybe this is something you might want to reconsider if thats still possible?Best regards;Ben,7 months ago,"I'm sorry to disappoint with the news of Micro USB; Ben. I do not think it will be possible at this stage for us to re-consider without significant delays in timeline. If the Micro USB is a dealbreaker and you are no longer interested we understand and will always offer a full refund to our backers; just shoot us an email to support@thelightphone.com. I really do wish we could  have USB-C as we initially aspired; but we made the decision that we thought made the most sense for the Light Phone.

Thanks for understanding!"
Hey Joe;Im interested in selecting the Black LP2 because of its aesthetics. But I'm curious; and a fool in regards to e-ink displays;... but at any rate; I'm curious do you know if it takes more energy to display a darker image or does it take less energy to reverse the polarity of the ink particles for a positive white image? I'm trying to decide if I want the black or grey version; I just am curious if the Light / Dark UI differences would net a greater battery life for the E-Ink Display.,7 months ago,"Hey Richard; Good questions. I do not think there is a real difference in the energy consumed to display either color. That being said; regardless of which color phone you chose; we want to have the option in settings to invert the display FYI.

Sweet! Sounds good Joe!"
Will we be able to use Google Fi with this phone? The Light Phone will likely be an auxiliary phone for me.,7 months ago,I'm not 100% sure David. Google Fi appears to be pretty proprietary with what models of phone can use their SIMs. I did read today they expanded to iPhones so maybe there is a way to get an exception. Other backers mentioned having successfully used Google Fi SIMs inside of not-officially compatible devices. Technically our phone uses the appropriate antennas bands to work on Google Fi; I just am not very familiar with it personally so hesitant to say they will allow Light Phone IIs.
Hey Joe; Love the last update and how you are developing the phone! I am pretty clumsy with phones; will the handset be tough enough to take a drop or two? And are there any plans for a case? Sorry if youve already answered this.,7 months ago,Hi Stephen; We will be putting the phone through many accelerated life tests and are pretty confident in the durability; however the front of the phone is glass and naturally susceptible to breaking with the wrong drop. We do plan to offer at least one case by launch; but we don't really have exact details yet; thanks for understanding!
Quick question: what's the refresh rate/general responsiveness for typing? I have a Kindle and find that I don't really like typing on it because the screen isn't super responsive. Is that similar on the Light Phone? I just don't want typing to be a pain.Also; for what it's worth; I actually really like the scheduled batch of notifications idea toyed with earlier. It's something I wish my iPhone would do. Less necessary on a LP; but I'd love an option for two to three batches per day.,7 months ago,"Ah; I just read your reply to someone else in regard to scrolling; but it applies here as well. Personally; I don't really care if it scrolls smoothly (that's a plus; but not necessary to me) but I just hope typing will feel as instantaneous as possible.

Noted re: batching notifications. There are a bunch of features like this that we want to survey and understand how to prioritize with our backers; so next update should be a fun one. As for responsiveness; it's something we think is key to the success (or not) of the Light Phone II and we have been spending a great deal of effort lately in trying to optimize this aspect. A lot of that work is a collaboration with our manufacturing partner's software team and our team...

...In general; I completely agree; if the typing is a pain that is a big problem. From what I've learned we have a touch screen which is what gathers inputs from your typing and is super responsive; and then there is the E-ink screen which is not as quick to display. The Kindle tries to animate each key which I think really makes it feel lagging. We have a few ideas to minimize delay in visual feedback (when you type how long until the letter appears) and perhaps offset with haptic feedback too."
Another question: I see references to a Light Plan; but I'm having trouble finding any details. Can you link me to some details about that? Really excited about this phone; it's exactly what I want!,7 months ago,Sorry we ahven't been able to share many details. We've been in talks with dozens of different partners trying to create the most affordable and streamlined experience we can. We hope that by the end of the year we can share all the details. The current goal is for a $25 unlimited calls/texts/basic service (updates from cloud; using simple tools etc.) and a more stripped down plan targeting parents/kids for around $15. Hotspot would be an optional upgrade... excited to share more about this!
What is the status of maps? That is the second most important feature after phone calls for me.,7 months ago,"Maps is at our high priority list as well; but we are still in the development of the core operating system and so there has not been much progress to maps other than ensuring that all of our hardware/software is capable of supporting it. We do think it's still possible to have a ""maps/directions"" tool for launch; but I don't have a tangible update at the moment. Thanks!"
Sorry if this was asked before; but will the phone support group text messaging?,7 months ago,Hi Jospeh; Sorry for my slow response; but yes the phone will support group text messages.
Hi! I would like to get a refund; please. How do I go about this?,7 months ago,"Hi Christopher; Just shoot us an email to support@thelightphone.com and we can help you out. We wish that Indiegogo had a more easy ""refund button"" but they do not. Thanks for understanding."
Hey Joe; when can we expect the next update?,7 months ago,Hi Nicolaos; I wanted to do an update before Thanksgiving; but I got tied up with some deadlines in order to keep everything moving full speed (our manufacturing partners don't have the same holiday schedule as us). We are ramping up and on-boarding a few new software engineers as well and I've been focused on making sure that process goes smoothly. I really want to try to get one out by end of the week! Thanks for the patience; it's really starting to pick up over here and get exciting :)
Howdy Joe; I originally put down my order for the black Light Phone 2 a while back; but now I'm leaning more towards the light grey. To me; it feels a lot less like a smartphone and more like an electronic note pad. Is there a way to change my order before you guys ship it out? Thanks!,7 months ago,Yep! We'll be giving everyone the opportunity to confirm their color as well as shipping addresses in case anyone has changed their mind or moved. I'm still on the fence between which color I want to use personally. We'll also have more updated photos/videos in the coming months which might also tip your opinion either way. Hope all is well!
Hey there! With the phone being so simple I don't want to use the passcode. However; it would be nice to be able to lock it from the website and put my contact information on the screen if I misplace it.,7 months ago,Noted! Thanks Bradley; added it to our list of feature ideas.
Hey Joe; Im so excited about this project and it looks like you guys are doing great! I was just wondering if the directions feature of the phone will be through a partnership with a mapping software like Google; or if it will be your own software that will be made through the light software.Thanks!,7 months ago,Hey Brett! Sorry for my slow response and thanks for the support! The directions will be our own interface (user facing designs); but will rely on a not yet decided third party; be it Google or other; for the information we provide. Hope that makes sense and that you enjoyed a nice holiday weekend :)
"hi joe; so stoked you're undertaking this increasingly necessary project - i've actually been searching for a low-maintenance e-ink phone for years with zero luck - major kudos to you and your team question: one of the most useful iPhone features is the scheduled ""do not disturb"" function; is there any plan or option for this in light phone 2? i love just leaving the phone alone knowing it won't bother me all night - the less i need to mess with it the happier i tend to be...thank you again!",7 months ago,"Hey! Thanks for the support; appreciate the kind words. We were actually just working out the plan for this last week. We don't yet have a plan for a ""scheduled"" batch of notifications; although that may be totally possible; but we will have a few easy ways to turn off all sounds and/or vibrate specific to calls/texts/alarm in the settings but also using the volume button you can turn off all sounds. I personally like no notifications for texts and manually checking; but having calls still ring.

thank you for your reply! so i should've been a little more clear - by scheduled i meant you could set a specific time period each day the phone would automatically enter a ""do not disturb"" mode - for example the iphone i have now goes quiet from around 10pm-9am each day; without me having to push any buttons; but i can still look at the notifications if i open the phone... maybe we're talking about the same thing; but you called it ""batch notifications""...? thank you again; cheers!!

I see; thanks for clarifying I had misunderstood. I thought you meant that every hour your notifications would appear as a batch; but I understand what you are referring to now. I've heard from other friends who use that function and love it too. While it's not in our current baseline requirements for initial shipping; I think notification control is super important to our brand and I'd love to find a way to support something like this. Definitely taking a note of the idea; thanks for sharing.

awesome thanks so much; looking forward to this project - cheers!"
Hi! You mentioned that you plan on supporting other languages after launch; how would that work; would there be an 'update' for existing phones to have other languages? Or would we have to buy another phone?,7 months ago,Hi River; It would not require another phone; simply a software update; but at the moment we don't have any timelines in place for additional language support (no tangible date for when that will be available).
Hello!The light phone doesn't seem like it will need very much data;  (other then directions there isn't much that requires data.) What would you think a good data plan would be for it? No worries if you don't have a specific answer :) I'm just thinking about future phone plans...,7 months ago,"Good point! It will be very low data usage indeed. I don't have any specific ones in mind per say; but we are planning to offer an option through Light directly in trying to make a super simple; competitively priced and tailored to our phones limited functionality. We are hoping for $25/mo unlimited calls/texts/maps/updates etc. and potential future options like hotspot/streaming data available as add ons. We understand how confusing carriers can be and want to make using the phone easier...

Our plan details are still to be finalized; we're speaking with a variety of partners trying to get that monthly cost as low as we can. Our plan will also of course be optional and it will be good for us to share some other options that are out there as well. If you already have a smartphone plan somewhere else and plan to keep it; it may be easy to add a line that shares that data for a lower monthly cost too and that's awesome (or some users will just swap the existing SIM as well at no cost)."
"Looking at the Kyocera KY-01L; it has the ability to scroll via dragging a finger on the screen; but it seems very; very choppy.I do see that in the previous update; there are parts that would be ""scrollable"". Does that mean scrolling by dragging a finger on the screen? Or does that mean navigating with the buttons on the side?I'd love if I could scroll by dragging my finger on the screen; and I really hope it'll be smooth.",7 months ago,"Hi; This is a good point with scrolling and we're currently working on that optimization on the software side. The phone has a nice touch screen and is very capable of using scroll gestures. The e-ink screen however is not as quick to load as OLED in terms of frame rate. We've done a few things to seriously minimize that by paginating the scrolls and working in the android OS to strip away of the default scrolling animations that appear to cause the e-ink to lag...

Without pagination the e-ink screen is trying to load 24 fps of a scroll by default which it can't do well and so it lags to refresh. With pagination each scroll only require 1 frame to load new information with makes a big difference. By pagination I mean that if you are looking at a list of six recent contacts and you scroll all six names will change; like you went to page 2 of the list rather than moving the list in tiny (24fps) increments like scrolling on a smartphone. Hope thats clear!"
Hi Joe;Just wondering if you plan on implementing the aptX HD or LDAC codecs? I know you haven't decided on music streaming yet; but is there any chance of supporting Tidal?On the WhatsApp topic - my E Ink watch (Sony SWR30) displays messages from my phone and you can reply to them using the mic. Could you do something similar - run the app invisibly in the background; then have a simple interface that to display the text and uses the keyboard to reply?,7 months ago,"Hi Chris; I'm going to have to refer to the our team for more information on the codec support of Light Phone II; I'm not sure off the top of my head. I think with all things future tools; we'd like to have options ( whether it's a tidal tool; a spotify tool; or an upload your own music player etc.) However in order for us to offer those tools; we'd most likely need some support from them (tidal) which may or may not be easy. It would would be a very slimmed down 'light' version as well...

...thanks for the reference point for WhatsApp. I'm pretty unfamiliar with smartwatches. We can certainly look at it as example/inspiration for how we might be able to incorporate it. We may not be able to run the full app in the background;  because we don't have the Android ""app store"" available on the Light Phone II; but that's a good idea. I'm curious to see how they solved the UX for it none the less. Appreciate you taking the time to share that."
Hey Joe;What do you think of the Kyocera KY-01L (coming out this month in Japan)? https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/18/kyocera-releases-tiny-e-paper-companion-phone-in-japan/,7 months ago,"Yes; I remember when this launched a few backers shared it with us. It's certainly very similar. Although thinner than our phone; I feel like the compromises they have made  (no front light; smaller battery; no headphone jack) remind me of some of my regrets with stripping down the original Light Phone to be as absolutely thin as possible (it was a mm thinner I think).  It's also limited to one carrier and has an internet browser etc. Overall more options for consumers is a good thing IMO.

i certainly hear you. I wonder what their goals were (besides for creating a tiny phone) with this product. It is certainly not designed to be ""light"" in terms of software. They likely used an e ink screen to make the battery last longer. It is an interesting concept; but i actually prefer the LP2 due to the simpler interface and more customizable features."
Sorry if this has been mentioned already (Indiegogo comments are not user-friendly); but if the border is less noticeable on light grey because the screen matches the border; and the shadow is less noticeable on black; why not offer dark grey (matching the darkest value e-ink can display) as the screen-matching option (instead of either black or light grey - or in addition)?,7 months ago,Hi Phoebe; I understand about the comments; it's no so user-friendly at all. The black model is actually the darkest grey of the e-ink (and the same for the light grey with the lightest shade of e-ink). Thanks for bringing this point up we should have been more clear about that.
please make it use USB-C if possible! One Mockup looked like micro usb charging port; but of course i know that nothing is certain / final in this stage.,7 months ago,I'm sorry for any confusion; we tried to make it clear in our updates; but we had to switch to Micro USB to avoid growing the length of the phone. If this is a deal breaker for you (no longer interested in Light Phone II because of it's lack of USB-C) I understand and we can certainly offer you a refund because we initially project using USB-C. We made the decision that we thought would make the most sense for the phone; thanks for understanding.
Hey Joe - I'm bored at work so just posting this comment to ask;How are you? How's the team? I imagine bringing something like this to market can be stressful; exciting & exhausting all at once!Do you have anything in the works at the moment to talk to tech sites/journalists so we can hopefully see some independent hands-on footage next year? Any conferences/trade shows you plan to hit?Cheers,7 months ago,"Hey Nicholas; Thanks for the thoughtful comment. Things are going well! That sounds like a pretty good description actually. I can certainly feel defeated when things don't go perfectly; as is naturally going to happen. Going light always reminds me how lucky I am to be working on something I'm so passionate about; how lucky I am that we've made it this far and met so many amazing people along the way; even if some days it feels like an impossible challenge that we've undertaken...

Weve had interest from journalists and we do want to share the Light Phone II with them eventually. We really want feedback; the good and bad too. I'm personally excited for beta testing with our own backers; which will happen earlier than the journalists. We dont have any commitments at the moment; pretty focused on product; but weve done Mobile World Congress in the past. Id love to go to SXSW. If you have any in mind that you think we should check out Im all ears; thanks!"
Hey will it be possible for me to buy without signing up with you all for a cell service? Can I just take my phone to my AT&T store; throw a SIM card in; and replace my current phone with it?,7 months ago,Yep of course; sorry for any confusion there! We definitely don't want to lock the phone to any carrier; we simply wanted to offer an option for interested users in a Light service plan as well. Thanks for helping clarify that one; Aaron; hope all is well.
On notifications:1. Will there be a blinking light for missed calls / texts like in most phones? Just curious; it makes sense if not.2. Its important to me that I be able to set notification settings individually. The way I do it; phone calls are for important / time sensitive matters; while texting is not something I want to be interrupted for. I'll check my texts when I want to.I want my phone to buzz when I get a call; but be silent when I get a text. Will this be doable?,7 months ago,Hi Guillermo; Hope you had a nice weekend. 1. I'm not familiar (coming from iPhones) with the blinking light for notifications; and we don't currently have plans to do so; but in theory it should be possible if users really want us to add it. 2. This is how I currently use my phone as well (only calls notify me; texts I check when I want to). We definitely want to have the ability to set that on the Light Phone as well. Thanks for pointing that out!
Really dont want to sound annoying; I cant wait for this phone but i'd really like to see some type of wireless charging alternative!Loving the progress.,7 months ago,"Hey Jason! Thanks for reaching out; and we don't find the comments annoying at all; we appreciate the feedback; even if we don't always have the desired answers. Currently the hardware is locked and so any wireless charging option would require some sort of ""smart case"" using the USB port. In theory this may be possible and we can see in our next survey what the interest level is for us to potential develop this; but the phone itself won't support wireless charging. Thanks for understanding!"
Hey Joe;Will the US version of the LP2 be compatible with carriers in the middle East such as Orange?,7 months ago,Hey Ben; I'm not sure; do you know what bands that carrier uses? The North American (US) model supports the following bands: B2; B4; B12; B13; B17; B25; B26. In general; compatibility outside of the intended region may not be great; but it really depends on which region/carrier because there is some overlap for sure. Hope that makes sense!
Could you please provide the standalone version of the dashboard which I could run on my own server or even my PC? The phone could then connect to it and I could manage it through my browser; but all data and everything would be kept on my own server. I am really trying to go away from the cloud and this was one of my main interests the phone.Alternatively; you could standardize the API the phone is using to communicate to your dashboard and then people could develop their own management tools.,7 months ago,Hi Mitar; Thanks for the feedback. We do plan to have a side-load option for updating the phone or trouble shooting manually; it just may not be as seamless of a UX as the cloud and involve using something like Android File Transfer to update the device rather than our designed interface. We are considering a standalone version and APIs we just don't want to overpromise at this stage as we are quite a small team still with a lot to do! This feedback is helpful; appreciate it and hope all is well
will there be a calendar / upcoming appointments feature?,7 months ago,It's something backers have asked for; we imagine it as an optional tool. Not 100% sure the details; but likely makes more sense to be an upcoming events rather than a full fledged functionality calendar; but when we get to building it we'll certainly ask for lots of user input. Cheers!
Hey Joe;Following up on the previous 2 cimments - will it be possible to transfer our blacklist from our current devices to our light phones? Asking for both Android as well as iPhone,7 months ago,"Not sure; seems pretty complicated to do automatically honestly (not sure Apple/Google gives easy permission for us to look at those things) and with our small team already with a lot on our plate and other things prioritizing our roadmap; I want to say most likely not for now. Good idea though; will take note and thanks for understanding!

Thanks for the transparency"
Any support planned for a call filtering system? I just realized today how much I appreciate being able to use Nomorobo; Hiya; or any other solution on my iPhone to block spam calls; and when I move to the light phone; that protection might potentially end.,7 months ago,Thanks for bringing this up Thomas. I'll look into the examples you shared; I'm not personally familiar; but call filtering is something that seems fitting to the Light Phone II (a distraction free phone!). I'm not familiar with their technology for blocking calls and understanding if something is spam; but maybe there is a collaboration we can do? For the original Light Phone we had a filter mode which only let contacts through. It worked for going light; but that's not a permanent solution.
Hey! I'm a new backer to the project and an excited for April! Two questions and forgive me if these have been asked before - I'm sure they have. First; what sort of features would potentially be available for blocking spam / robo calls? And second; what sort of auto-correct / word completion / spell check will be included for messaging? Thanks in advance.,7 months ago,"Hey Ryan! Glad to have you as a backer :) At a minimum I want a blacklist option to block numbers but that is a retroactive process. Is there an example of features that do this sort of thing that we can look at for inspiration? Spam calls are an annoying distraction we'd love to keep off the Light Phone as much as possible. Currently in our initial plan we don't have any auto-correct/word completion; but auto-correct might be something easy to implement should we find users really want it.

On the initial Light Phone; we had a filter mode that only allowed calls from contacts (which were only 9 speed dials on that device) and that prevented spam calls from happening; but that wasn't intended to be a permanent solution; it just ensured when you were light you wouldn't get a spam call."
Hi Joe; As usual thanks for all the updates and comment responses. I was hoping you could comment on when you envision having a locked in breakdown of plan costs etc i know it has been ballparked to be $15 and $35 thresholds. Also how will the light plans choose which carrier we are hooking up to? ie where i live Verizon is about the only option of the 3 you have listed for the US.,7 months ago,"We were hoping to do so in the last update; but have been finalizing partnerships is taking longer than expected. We may be able to get pricing to be more like $25 for unlimited calls/text and data for basic OS operation and updates. If the user wants to add the ability to hotspot/stream that could be offered as additional data packages to the plan; but we are still trying to lock that down at the moment. Once we finalize the plan we'll be able to share the exact coverage and carriers that...

...our SIM will be using on the backend. I know Verizon was one of them; but I'd like to be able to get a more specific map because I know some of the partnerships utilize a variety of carriers (ATT; Tmobile; Verizon really). We're essentially working as an MVNO in this case; if you are familiar with the term. Regardless; there may be other MVNOs that use Verizon solely and may be more appropriate than our plan for your needs. Looking forward to sharing our proposed plans in the near future!"
@Joe at this time I would like to request a refund. Can you email me directly with instructions how to do so ?,7 months ago,Hi Eric; I just emailed you; but leaving it here for anyone else; please just email support@thelightphone.com and we can always offer a refund to your pledge before we begin shipping. Thanks again for spending time with our project and hope that we can share a future Light product with you down the road. Best; Joe
Hey Joe; I'm speaking at the DMWF e-commerce and marketing conference at Javits Center tomorrow. I know it's very last minute but I have a few free passes left and would like to invite you and a +1. The tickets are worth $800 each and are good for tomorrow (Wednesday) as well as Thursday; all day. You have my email (maybe my phone number as well). Please reach out via email as well as text ASAP if you'd like to join so that I can get you on my guest list.I would love to meet you tomorrow!!!!!!,7 months ago,Hey Ben! Thanks for the super generous offer; but I'm not going to be able to make it to the city today. In the future; you can always reach me at joe@thelightphone.com; cheers and best of luck with your presentation!
Hi;On the last update it looks like  screen to body ratio is about 70-75 %; is this actually how it will be in the final product? or is this just on the prototype?,7 months ago,Hi Shmili; The photographs are of a prototype; but it is representative of the actual screen size that will be on the final product.
I noticed on another comment that you said airplane mode would cut all radios. This doesnt necessarily make sense to me because (at least on my iPhone) airplane mode only cuts off the cell signal + data; the bluetooth and wifi still stay on unless I click those off too. Plus; there are some scenarios; like on an airplane; where wifi is an option; but cellular is not.  It might make more sense to have a faraday mode where all radios cease to transmit to avoid confusion + increase functionality,7 months ago,"David; Thanks for your close attention to the details. I believe I misspoke; and you are correct about airplane mode only cutting cell signal + data. Bluetooth and wifi are off by default but not controlled by airplane mode; sorry for that slip. I think such an option you describe makes sense; we do plan to have a dashboard for turning things like bluetooth; wifi; airplane mode on and a way to 100% cut everything is a good idea. Will see what we can do. (Is faraday mode a common name for this?)

Im pretty sure its not common; but it seems like a fitting name for the feature. All radios off or completely disconnected would make sense too; they just dont sound as good to my ears."
I love how things are shaping up and can't wait for April. Great work across the board. I do have one very minor comment. The most recent update is my first time seeing the back of the phone and I can't help but feel like the logo is kind of enormous; especially in the face of such a minimal UI and general concept. Just my 2 cents; thanks!,7 months ago,Appreciate it Ron! We will be tightening up all those design elements still; so thanks for the two cents. Right now it was printed in a transparent ink; so it is visible when reflecting light; but subtle otherwise. I was trying to show it off in those photos. There will need to be some small regulatory typography/icons at the bottom as well; which we also printed in transparent ink for the first Light Phone and we will keep as small as possible. Minimal is the goal; so thanks for that feedback.
Can i have refund please?,7 months ago,"We can certainly offer you a refund; unfortunately there is not an easy ""refund button"" on this platform so you will need to please email support@thelightphone.com. Sorry for the inconvenience and sincere thank you for spending some time with and supporting our project. I do hope our paths cross again in the future."
"Love the product; looks like it's starting to come together. Main concern for me is the 8gb of space. Being that this isn't a ""smart"" phone I would assume the OS won't rob much of that; but still 8gb isn't much. I don't know what is physically storing that memory; so forgive me if i'm way off base here; but the price difference between a 32gb micro SD and a 128gb micro sd card is all but $10.  I can only assume that it is doable to increase the internal memory with minimal changes/cost?",8 months ago,"Hi Kenny; Thanks for voicing this concern. It's true that the OS is fairly light weight; although I don't have the exact file size number at the moment. Considering the phone does not support media (photo/video) we felt that 8gb was adequate for our users needs. Obviously when thinking of something like storing an entire music library the 8gb limit becomes much smaller. I don't think there are size or internal changes that would be necessary and the cost of increased memory is reasonable...

... perhaps we may be able to offer a model with more memory down the road; but that really complicates or SKUs and forecasting while we are at our super small current scale. I will ask about this in a future survey and see what the interest is; no promises of course; but maybe this is something we can offer in the future. Thanks again for taking the time to comment and hope all is well."
This is epic! Have you considered a built in quick calendar or reminder tool? For those commenting on a built in note function; I think this would be great tool too; but as a workaround one could always just text/message themselves? All ideas aside; I feel the core of this phone is simplicity. For all of us (myself included); we need to remember that this is not meant to be  a smart phone; this is supposed to get us away from that. Less is more. :) Stay the course Joe and keep up the great work!,8 months ago,"Thanks Robert! I think that's an interesting immediate work around. Another backer had a similar idea and even had a few ways that would be perhaps easy for us to develop that would optimize that ""note to self"" functionality. I used to send myself email one liners to remember an idea I had when I was at my computer next so another idea was to build a super simple note to self tool that just auto emails it (text or audio maybe) to your email. Anyhow thanks for the support!"
Regarding wireless charging: There are Receiver Modules are that can be attached to the USB jack. A Receiver of 69x44 mm brings about 1000mA. Why not create a slim silicon case with built-in module for those who want to load wirelessly?,8 months ago,Good point; Franz. That might be possible for us to do for sure. We'd need to prove that enough backers were interested for it to make sense for us to develop such a case; and it's also something third parties could certainly offer as well. Thanks for sharing that idea!
I came across a passage that reminds me of Light Phone 2. From Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art by Virginia Heffernan:The first Kindle; unlike the other devices I carried; didnt pulse with clocks; blaze with video; or squall with incoming bulletins and demands. Instead it was reserved; with something on a continuum with a stones integrity and self reliance.Technology in productive tension with other technology has a special pleasure to it. p. 83Keep up the great work! I cant wait.,8 months ago,Lovely quote; thanks for sharing Will. I'm interested now in in reading the book; it's got an intriguing title. Hope that all is well!
Will we be seeing any cases upon release?,8 months ago,Hi Jason. We do want to have at least one case option for backers at our initial shipping; but because the lead time for those is much less we haven't yet explored them deeply enough to know what exactly the case options will be. Thanks for bringing this point up though; we have many users interested in a case; and we'd like to have that option available to ship with your phone in April. Cheers; Joe
Joe;The new update looks absolutely fantastic.  I'd be totally content with something that looks like the prototype.I've said it before; I'll say it again to be annoying: please consider a notepad!  I don't care if it's tight or clumped.  I'm by no means an expert but I reckon that if a text conversation will fit on the screen; a few lines of notes would; too.Regardless; I'm anxiously counting down the months.  Your transparency and community involvement are admirable.  Thank you; Bear,8 months ago,Thanks Bear!! I think it's safe to assume there will be some note options eventually for the Light Phone based off how many backers have expressed an interest. Once we get to flushing those out; I'd like to work with backers to understand if it's more of a note to future self (perhaps email the text/audio to self) or if it's a note pad for viewing on the device itself later; or maybe two separate options. Hope all is well; Joe
Will it support those emergency messages like earthquake warning or amber alert and can user optin/optout from it?,8 months ago,"Great question; and I'll try my best to answer for our stage of development. The phone will support such messages (WEA - wireless emergency alerts). Ideally we'd want to offer the option to opt in/out; but there are also some notifications like the Presidential Alerts that I don't believe are possible to opt out of at all. We believe it's the consumer's right to choose whether or not; and our goal is to make it optional whenever it is possible for us to make that choice available to our users.

At this stage; I'm not yet sure what those options will be; I hope that makes sense!"
After seeing the last update and looking at some examples I am more hyped and looking forward to Light 2. This could be the best ever purchase iev made on Indiegogo. I wish it had whatsap/telegram integration for messages but lets see if that comes in the future or not. Besides its not a big thing when you look at its gorgeous minimalist design and font/style/Ui overall its a masterpiece on its own. GREAT WORK TEAM!,8 months ago,Thanks Ali! So glad you enjoyed the update; hope all is well.
Hey Joe; just saw your reply from almost a week ago. Not sure if you'll get a notification of my reply so I'll leave a new comment. I had mentioned turning the phone around to use the up/down buttons to move the cursor left/right. I think you thought I meant typing in portrait mode but I just meant switching the landscape orientation you have in the latest update so the buttons are on top. Then you can tap them with your index fingers as you type with your thumbs. Hopefully that makes sense!,8 months ago,Thanks Thomas. I do get notifications for replies; but not new comments to the page; but either way works for me! I do get it now; I was misunderstanding you before thanks for clarifying that. It's a very interesting idea; one I had not considered and I will certainly be testing it.  I'm holding one of the protos now; it's pretty easy to use those buttons in landscape too. Really appreciate the suggestion.
Wireless charging by any chance?,8 months ago,Unfortunately I don't think it will be possible to wirelessly charge the Light Phone II; thanks for understanding!
Hello! I saw somewhere that it was possible to get a refund of my backing-- but I cannot seem to get a hold of someone to help me do this. Can someone help me get my money back? It still looks like a wonderful project; but my plans have changed! Thank you in advance! Best; Micaela,8 months ago,"No problem and sorry that it is not more clear. If you can email us at support@thelightphone.com we can send you a refund; unfortunately Indiegogo doesn't make this as easy as a ""refund button"" as we would like. Thanks again for spending time with our project and hope our paths cross again soon!

Thanks so much; Joe! It's a wonderful project and I'm hoping to be able to back it later on... I appreciate the prompt response! I just emailed support."
Will you guys have some type of airport app?,8 months ago,What did you have in mind? There is an airplane mode for sure; which cuts off all radio signals; but as for a tool for airports we don't yet have plans.
Any chances to have wireless charging?thanks for the recent udpate; it looks neat,8 months ago,Hi Nico; I don't think the Light Phone II won't be able to have wireless charging; thanks for understanding :)
I apologize in advance because I'm sure this has already been addressed; but I did look through the comments for over an hour and wasn't able to find a clear; definitive answer. Will we be able to completely disable text messages? I currently have no desire to have texting at all. I'm really excited about this phone. You guys are doing terrific! Thanks!,8 months ago,"Hi John; thanks for trying to find it and really sorry you spent so much time with no luck finding your answer! It has not been asked or answered yet I don't believe on here. I need to double check that our setting includes a way to completely disable messaging; but that should be relatively simple for us to include and I think its a nice feature to offer; so thanks for bringing it to my attention again. FYI you can also ask your carrier to disable all messaging as well on most any plan I think

Great! I currently own an iphone and you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to disable texting altogether; which I was never able to fully achieve; at least with T-Mobile. Random messages would still somehow leak through. It's annoying that you can't delete certain proprietary apps on the iphone. While I'd certainly give it another go to disable through T-Mobile with the Light Phone; it would be nice to disable the texting component altogether and not have it show on the Light Phone's GUI/menu

Thanks for the thorough feedback;  I totally get how that best solution would be never even seeing the GUI on the phone at all; I'll see what we can do there because that makes sense. Good to know that the carriers are not a fool proof solution as I maybe thought to disabling messages; I have not had personal experience trying that; I was only aware that they allow you to ""disable"" at the carrier level. Proprietary apps on the iphone always drove me crazy too... Hope you have a nice weekend!"
I'd like a setting which allows us to map a double click of the dedicated tools button. This could jump you to a favorite tool such as phone; settings; or invert the display. Additionally; a press and hold could launch the voice memo tool and automatically begin recording. On release it could offer to email you the mp3. A transcription along the way would be cool; but may present privacy concerns. What tough decisions are you guys thinking through right now?,8 months ago,"That's an interesting idea to make navigating to one's most common tools. In theory; this seems doable. By default it could be ""blank"" and our power users have the option to go into settings and assign a command to those functions. I've definitely taken note and will see what we can do. We had a similar idea for ""note to self"" tool; but we only imagined it so far as an (optional) tool and with two buttons to either record audio or type on keyboard; and it would send to one's email...

Right now; were pretty much going through the motions of getting the core OS up and running smoothly and as bullet proof as possible (bug-free). We run into little hurdles regularly in this process; but there is nothing that seems like a deal breaker at this moment that we'd need to make a tough decision around a trade off. Our tough decisions going forward will be around prioritizing our next developments (whether its OS features like you mention above or creating our additional tools/SDK).

I do really like that question though. We have had to make some tough decisions last spring and through the summer in getting to our DFM (Design for Manufacturing). One example was deciding to switch to Micro USB vs making the phone longer. Overall we think it was the right decision for the majority of our users; but it definitely was a deal-breaker for some backers understandably. Hope all is well and thanks again for the suggestion."
I think 8GB should be plenty for people who want to have some music on their device. An MP3 music file is around 10MB (a good quality audio file for a 4 minute song). So if you allocate around 6 GB to music on the device (as the OS and other tools arent likely to take up that much storage); one could store around 600 songs. This seems like a very decent number for a phone that is designed not to be used much. Personally; I would only store around 100 of my favourite songs.,8 months ago,Thanks David; that's very well said and aligned with our thinking. I wasn't trying to say that the phone isn't capable of working as a music player; it's just that if music is your biggest priority there are probably better standalone options (I'm thinking of a flac music player; classic ipod or even your old smartphone with no SIM).  Our focus is to make the best simple phone we can. Cheers and thanks for that feedback.
For music; I mean is it possible to have a music service like spotify; pandora; etc?,8 months ago,"In theory yes; it is totally possible for us to have music streaming which wouldn't have the same issue with memory but comes at the cost of needing signal and draining more battery. We'd like to have options like that available on the phone for sure; we've had a lot of requests to be able to stream a Spotify playlist for instance.

okay then that's fine. Because with the limited space; I thought the music streaming route would help solve the music library issue."
I am really sorry to see that there won't be a real music player. This for me is the point where I leave this project. I'm really sorry but wish you all the best.,8 months ago,"Sorry for any confusion; we can certainly offer you a refund if you are no longer interested. The Light Phone will most likely have a few options for playing music (uploading your own songs or streaming). I just wanted to be honest that this was not designed to be the be the best music player in the world and our focus is on making it the best simple phone that we can. It'd be great if it can play songs for day to day needs; but it can't hold my entire music library. Thanks for the wishes!

I have the nokia 3310 and I like it very much. The almost perfect phone (13 days battery) with a functioning mp3 player.Sadly; the menu of the mp3 player sucks; the songs are randomly organized. Useless for me. I like to listen to albums in the correct order. I know this is old skool but I can't stand random lists of songs. So for me a good mp3 player was essential. No need for more than 8gb storage but the menu must be good. I'm sad to go; but I hope the others will be happy with their phones.

Thanks!"
Thanks for the new information; you are reassuring. According to the original description; 8GB of memory is provided. As far as music can be played; it seems to me to be very little. In view of the fact that a larger memory does not require more space; I think a larger memory makes sense; even if this would mean more costs.,8 months ago,"That's correct; 8gb; which is not a ton of music. I used the analogy that it's more like an shuffle with a few playlist than a full-fledged ipod music player. It is possible to fit more memory without increasing the size of the phone; we currently don't have that as an option but if it were greatly desired we could consider a model with more memory. I'm also concerned about the UX of navigating a huge library of music on such a small screen easily. It's not great on huge iPhones even IMO.

It would certainly be against the idea of the Lightphone to install a complete player. But the lightphone will be my only phone. So it would be nice to have on the trip 3-4 hours of music with me. Without a complete menu; just shuffle the loaded tracks. The size of the memory depends; of course; on how much the system is consuming"
Any plans to build in tethering capabilities? Would love to hotspot to my laptop when in a crunch.,8 months ago,Yep; we imagine it will exist as an optional tool for interested users. I can certainly see the value for certain crunch situations.
If it will be used for music; its going to need space to store the songs.How much memory will this phone have?,8 months ago,While we do want to have a way for users to play music if they want; we'd be doing a disservice to think of this phone as a full-fledged music player. There is an 8gb hard drive; which needs to be shared with everything else. I think it's more like a shuffle with a playlist or few rather than a full blown ipod with all of your favorite songs ever.
I've always said I could go without a smartphone if it weren't for directions & uber. This is literally everything I've ever wanted in a phone!,8 months ago,Amazing; Elle; very excited to have you as a backer. I cannot wait to share the Light Phone II with you this April :)
Thank you for the amazing September update and Medium posts. I 100% share your thoughts about AIM - I've had specifically the same thoughts and remember how going on the internet used to be so fun.  I'm so excited for the real thing.  Is there any hope of future NFC payments support? I noticed the Snapdragon Wear 2100 supports NFC. To me this would be a helpful; non intrusive tool.,8 months ago,Hi Jack; So glad you enjoyed the update; makes me really happy (especially that someone else relates to how I felt about AIM!). As for NFC however; I don't think we have the necessary hardware (although our Qualcomm chip technically supports it) in the Light Phone currently to open up NFC use cases. Sorry for not having better news there.
I had the first Fairphone and there was a dedicated forum where users could post their issues with apps and stuff. Those thoughts were used to improve the apps in the next update. This worked really; really well. Maybe we could have somethign like that as the LP2 community.,8 months ago,Interesting and really good point. We certainly were thinking of a way for users to share that feedback with us easily/quickly; but I can see your point with the value of it being more of a community. Will certainly keep this in mind as something we can do; really appreciate you taking the time to share that suggestion. It would be silly for us to not work closely with our backers to improve the phone. Glad to hear it worked well with the Fairphone! (I'm really inspired by their mission)
Commend* Id also love to see a ride share feature as well!,8 months ago,Ride share was quite high on that priority list; noted :)
Hey Joe! I honestly cant combed you and the team enough for this endeavour! I have read the previous comment about a dictionary to be apart of the tool box- I read it might not be available at launch but I truly hope it will be available somewhere down the line. I feel its a must have in the toolbox. Either way; keep up the good work!,8 months ago,Hi Jason; thank you for the kind words! That's a correct assumption about dictionary; while the interest was lower than some of the other tools we're going to prioritize so it likely won't be available by our initial launch to all of our backers; but I think it would be a wonderful option to at least have available for backers eventually. Cheers!
To be honest Joe; I'm looking at the new update and it looks even better than the promo. I love the slick; simple; non-animation look.  I love the article from medium too.,8 months ago,Thanks Mike! Really glad to hear that; hope all is well. Looking forward to more updates like this one
What are the options for using headphones with this phone?headphone jack? Bluetooth? Both?Upon review of the new images; it looks fantastic. Looking at the new images; I don't really mind the slight borders around the E-ink screen.Visually; you've got a good product. If you achieve what the wireframes show; you've done an amazing job. Either way. I appreciate the work you're doing.,8 months ago,Thank you for the kind words and support. There is both a head phone jack and an option for Bluetooth. The Bluetooth was added after the campaign stretch goal and was highly desired by an overwhelming amount of our backers. We hope that compatibility is straightforward with most Bluetooth devices. Headphone jack was one of the most request additions from original Light Phone users who wanted a hands-free way to use the Light Phone. I'm glad we have both options now. Cheers
Well Done; Joe!  All I can say; is the sooner the better!! :),8 months ago,"Thanks!! Totally agree; I wish we could speed the process up too :)

I totally understand :)"
Joe; can you comment on the vibration strength of the Light Phone 2? Having a strong vibration motor is critical to me to avoid missing calls and texts. I just had to return a basic phone I got that I hoped would last me through until the Light Phone 2 ships because it's vibration was too weak. Thanks for any information you can share!,8 months ago,"Good point. I'm not sure how best to describe the vibration of the phone objectively; but I do think it will be sufficient. We're using a common vibrator from smartphones; I believe; so it is likely more powerful than the one of your basic phone and comparable from what you might expect from a phone coming from smartphones. I agree that this important; and would consider it crucial aspect of the phone. Thanks for pointing that out.

Have you felt the vibration in any prototypes? If so; how would you guess it compares to the vibration of the iPhone SE? I understand a pared-down one of those is what you use currently. I had some problems with the vibration of the iPhone SE which I think might be due to its size. Hence; my concern with the even tinier Light Phone 2.

I have briefly; but it wasn't in the right context. I didn't test it in my pocket and unexpectedly feel it vibrate to notify me of something. Someone made a phone call to it on a table in front of us and it sounded fine in that I didn't even think to question it at the time. I haven't been bothered by the SE's vibrator performance so maybe I need to find a better way to test ours than just my personal opinion. In a similar vein I want to start sharing some sound samples soon too for feedback..."
By the way; the header image in your September update looks like building 3 in the Brooklyn Navy Yard (corner dosest to the employee lot).Is that where your offices are?,8 months ago,"I meant building 6

That was a photo of building 3 I believe; good eye! (it's the big one closest to Flushing ave) We're in the Navy Yard and have a small office inside of the Newlab building (www.newlab.com)... cheers!

I'm 10-15 minutes away. Hello neighbor!

Hey Joe; I'm speaking at the DMWF e-commerce and marketing conference at Javits Center tomorrow.I know it's very last minute but I have a few free passes left and would like to invite you and a +1. The tickets are worth $800 each and are good for tomorrow (Wednesday) as well as Thursday; all day. You have my email (maybe my phone number as well). Please reach out via email as well as text ASAP if you'd like to join so that I can get you on my guest list."
Hey Joe; what do you think of keypad texting when in portrait mode like we used to do on flip phones back in the day?,8 months ago,"I see it's called ""t9"" I believe. Personally having spent a month with the new Nokia 3310 I really didn't like t9; but I understand others might feel different. The Nokia had physical buttons and it also had the abc; def ;etc under the numbers on the buttons. It might complicate the UX too; but maybe it's just a preference setting either keyboard or keypad t9. As it stands I don't think we'll support it out the gate; but if everyone wants it we can certainly explore how to make it work. Cheers!"
"You are concerned about the noticeable screen borders; and you are wrestling with fitting everything on the small screen.Both of these issues could possibly be solved by increasing screen to body ratio.If we can't hide the screen borders; then lets push to the borders of the screen. This could be feasible for the left; right; and bottom borders; and if it won't work for the top due to the listening piece; then we can just call that a ""bezel"" like other phones.Is the problem space / cost?",8 months ago,"I do understand this point. We went to E-ink with our first Light Phone to see what size screen could fit and this is what we made. Because our phone grew slightly longer to accommodate antenna needs; we could probably grow the screen a hair longer (not really above for reasons you mention and the sides as are about as wide as they can go). If we wanted to change that now it would cost upwards of $500k for tooling and 6 months time delay for potentially minimally longer screen.

If you look on the Medium page about the screen; you can see a drawing of the E-ink module. There are electronics attached to the module that prevent it from covering the whole front face of the phone. Hope that makes sense and thanks for understanding!"
The latest update raises some concerns; specifically with the web portal for device management. Firstly; I don't want to sign up for any account anywhere in order to add a tool to my phone. Secondly; a centralized service for managing multiple devices might seem enticing to the average end user; but those are very tempting targets for hackers. Will there be an alternative method for device management; say a dedicated application or browser extension? Will there be an SDK?,8 months ago,"Thanks for pointing out your concerns. It may be possible for us to build a dedicated application; but that would still need to talk to a server (as the website does) where the tools/updates live and whether or not you had ""an account"" there would be an identifier for your phone so we could send the appropriate updates. We really thought hard about this and feel that this system makes the most sense for our users and phone all things considered...

We hope to eventually have an SDK available; and we imagine that would be downloaded from the same account dashboard. If of course this news is a deal breaker; I'm very sorry and we will always offer refunds prior to shipping. We thought this dashboard would be a truly exciting update and I do appreciate the critical feedback. Thanks for understanding!"
Thanks for the latest update!Some things came to mind:1. The boarders of the screen are quite visible.        - Will this be on the final version (& white version) too?2. The screen seems a little out of proportion.        - Is this the final screen size?        - What is the bottom area (below the screen) reserved for?3. The phone seems thicker than the previous version.        - Are these the final dimensions?Besides that; keep up the work;  everything looks great!Cheers;Jan,8 months ago,"Thanks! 1. It is not final; and we are trying everything we can possibly try to optimize the screen border shadow and color difference as much as possible. It's likely that it will improve but I'm hesitant to say it will be invisible.2. That is the final screen size; yes. There are electronics attached to the E-ink module that are hidden below the bottom area I believe is the reason that is the screen size.3. The phone may change ~.1mm but that is pretty much final thickness.

Thanks for the fast reply! :)Looking forward to the next update!"
In the Medium article; you talked about the shadow (https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*eaBJHwbN0mHOXYzxP2JQcw.jpeg) created when the different transparent layers are stacked on top of each other (https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YqnKI2J1sW-nXnaIutwqcQ.jpeg).Would it minimize the shadow if they were stacked as an inverted pyramid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(architecture)) ?Anyway; I'm confident the phone will look great and top quality.Thank you again,8 months ago,"Hey there and thanks for the suggestions (those building look awesome!).  We did try a test of something like this; and what happened is we had 3 smaller shadows like tiers down to the screen layer and it unfortunately looked weirder than the one shadow perfectly around the active display. Really appreciate the time you took to share that though! Can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you!

Thank you for taking the time to answer. It makes great sense."
"This update is so great and the Light Phone is getting more and more appealing :-)Two things that crossed my mind :1. are ""contact favorite"" on track ? Pined on top of chronological list; access will be easier2. will it be possible to customize date and time format ? For instance; ""1:30 PM"" or ""13:30"". Dates are even more different.Anyway; thank you for the hard work you put into this project and to explain it to us.",8 months ago,"1. Interesting suggestion. Currently we had not that to do something like that. We at point explored a ""favorite tab"" but our thinking was that it was too cluttered and that most times my favorites were also usually in the first two pages of recents naturally so it felt redundant. But maybe that's a good middle ground option for users; thanks we will keep it in mind. 2. Yes of course; I also prefer 24 hour clock. It should be easy to have a few date/time options; thanks.

Thank you.You're right about favorite : it is not as usefull as I thought.As for locale customisation; this is great news too. I hope texting in other language will be possible too. Ben's idea about using dictionnary make much sense if different keyboard for different character set is not possible.Anyway; thank you for your kind anwer."
I like this update a lot! The minimalism is something I really adore; as well as the functionality the phone will offer. Two things I want to mention:I really want to have the date complication on the standby screen.The second things is only an idea; where I want to put into into the room; that the Pixel 3 has a laser-etched screen; but it attracts scratches very fast (some can be washed off). Advantage: feeling of the texture; but maybe consider etching the inside of the glass?,8 months ago,"Edit: I meant to say the Google Pixel 3 has a laser-etched back-glass. The other thing: displaying the date wont cause much energy consumption; as it only needs to be refreshed once a day. I only dont know whether there is space available for displaying it.

Hi Alexander; Thanks! I just want to clarify what do you mean by ""date complication on standby screen""?  It should be possible but want to make sure I understand you correctly. I see your point with Pixel 3; and we'll be doing a lot of testing of the final finishes to ensure they last long and withstand scratches. Our original Light Phone had a similar method too and we didn't have an issue with users scratching the phone as far as I'm aware. We are testing both internal and external etching.

Hi Joe; Thanks for your reply! I want to be able to see the date on the standby screen. The mockups only show the time; but not date. I want to be able to find out; what day it is (e.g. Friday) and which date today is (e.g. 26. October 2018).

Ah gotcha; that totally makes sense. We haven't 100% fully got the standby screen working under our control yet (not that it's not working we just haven't built and tested it yet) but I don't see that as an issue at all. On the stand by or home screen I imagine it'd be nice to offer a few time/date options for users. Great feedback; I'm sure others would like this too; appreciate you bringing it to my attention :)

Thanks Joe :-)"
Great update! I like the cleanliness of the proposed interface. I am hoping the Light Phone 2 will be able to take the SIM card I have in my Galaxy Note 9 and just work. Even though AT&T prefers I use their branded phones; I've mostly been able to switch devices as I've wanted to without issue. I'd like to hope the Light Phone 2 won't present any challenges in that area.I am looking forward to seeing functioning prototypes.,8 months ago,"Thanks Kevin. That's certainly our goal and I don't see any reason why that wouldn't work with your AT&T SIM.  I'm so looking forward to functioning prototypes. There are still a lot of things I want to test with the interface on the final phones so I'm eager to get there; even if it's not the 100% final aesthetic design; to be able to hold the phone and click through the interfaces is so exciting. Cheers!

Joe; thanks for the reply. Excellent news. So...can I have mine NOW; please? :)"
Any chance we can get more info on compatibility of incoming text in other languages such as Hebrew or Arabic?,8 months ago,Hi Ben; At this point without being able to test it I'm not sure how well it will be compatible with incoming texts in other languages. It's why we've conservatively only promised English to date; but it may work pretty seamlessly; I'm just not sure. Thanks for understanding.
I would be grateful that the tools option contain dictionary.  Because the light phone with the touch screen qwerty; then with out a handy dictionary would seem like something missing for a tooling.,8 months ago,"Hey! I personally also like the idea of dictionary tool. Even when I'm reading sometimes I like to look up words and get a more solid definition. In our first survey the Dictionary was voted pretty low on the user priority list; so while we certainly wouldn't mind offering such a tool; it may not be one of the first available. Thanks for understanding!

Thanks for your kind consideration."
Joe; thanks so much for the latest update. Loved the more comprehensive look at the UX and a good size comparison. Really helped me get a better idea of what it'll be like to use the phone. It's really interesting seeing the phone app have messaging built in; showing missed calls and such. Really slick. Will you also access voicemails through there? My only suggestion for that screen is to make your outgoing text grey so the eye will be naturally drawn only to incoming text.,8 months ago,"Also; for the texting screen; it'd be cool to flip the phone the other way to type and then be able to use the up/down buttons to move the cursor left/right; either letter by letter (if tapped) or word by word (if held). Maybe a little less friction with the small screen.

Thanks; Thomas; glad that was able to clarify some things; and I appreciate your participation in the comment section very much too! Voicemails would also live in that feed atm. We aren't sure if a dedicated voicemail box in the settings also makes sense so that's TBD. We'll be trying some hierarchy design like gray to make sure that page is clear; good point. I like the idea of using the physical buttons to scroll; that's clever; our concern with portrait typing is just down to size.

We will at least test if it's possible; but if you take a credit card and hold it portrait mode you can see what we mean; it's pretty tiny QWERTY keyboard unfortunately. Thanks for the suggestion regardless!"
So I just reviewed the new update... THE GREY COLOR IS TOO WICKED!!!Absolutely stunning; wowOwow; cheers Joe :),8 months ago,Cheers Ian!!
especially with texting landscape it may seem squashed or tiny. and the screen font may seem too small portrait mode. However they are just a mock-up and may improve in next mock-up. hope to see more photos and core updates.,8 months ago,Thanks for the feedback Lorenzo. The length grew mostly to support 4G antennas which to over simplify them work with an antenna at the top and bottom of the phone to triangulate the tower and more effectively direct it's signal. The thickness mostly grew for headphone jack; and the battery was able to grow because of that too. It's not possible for us to increase the size of the screen at this stage; thanks for understanding!
Hi joe nice To see the progress on next mockup stage. I have concerns in the new mock-up 1 the length is no longer a credit size phone and bigger than original but I understand for battery increase etc. I do like the front design remind me of window 10 532/iPhone 4. 2 the screen is now flushed top to bottom which is good but the spacing in top and bottom my seem not ideal,8 months ago,
That's what I call a great update! I'm happy with you taking the design seriously and paying extra attention to the details. The OS-stuff looks intuitive as well; keep it up!,8 months ago,Thanks; Kevin; appreciate the support and feedback!!
Impressive. Even more impressive is the fact that you have Alan Watts on speed dial!,8 months ago,A personal hero. Glad someone noticed ;) Cheers Paul!
Love the cat's paw in the update photos!  Keep up the great work!,8 months ago,Aw thanks Oliver! She somehow makes an appearance in almost everything I do it seems :)
Im very happy with the new update after the worrying August update. I do have one question/concern however. Why in the mock-ups is the bottom bezel so large? I am not concerned with this because ill be on my phone for long periods of time; but because it looks like the small screen will make typing messages very difficult. Thank you and keep up the great work!,8 months ago,"Glad to hear it Nathaniel. I really didn't mean to make anyone worry; sorry! I totally understand your question. We approached E-ink over a year ago about a module that could fit a credit card sized phone with a super high resolution and this was the module that they were able to come up with within our constraints. To the best of my understanding; there are electronics with the E-ink module that sit around the display and prevent it from being full front of the phone. That being said...

As the phone grew longer than the original credit card size to accommodate the 4G antennas; we did speak with them about the possibility of making the screen a little longer; but they relayed that we'd have to re-tool and customize the module which would cost upwards of $500k  and up to 6 months timeframe and they were not sure how much longer it would actually be able to grow. Ultimately we felt this was not worth it; considering it might only be a nominal increase; I hope that makes sense.

The screen is quite small no doubt; but so far in our UX explorations it does seem to be sufficient for such a 'light' phone. Messaging is currently limited to landscape mode for this reason; but in landscape mode the keyboard itself is slightly larger than on my iPhone SE and it fits pretty nicely in the hand while typing horizontally I must say; at least for my hands. Thanks for the question!

Ah thank you. I had a feeling that that may have been the reason. Its good to hear though that the landscape keyboard is larger than the one on your SE. It was difficult to comprehend the size just based on the mock ups. Thank you and keep up the great work!"
I have been telling everyone about this and Im so excited to get mine! I love the Tools being handled via the web interface; and now I want to buy 3 more for my kiddos!! Keep up the great work!,8 months ago,Amazing; thanks so much for the continued support Jessica; so glad to hear that you're excited :)
Interface sounds good; the last few pics look very thick though.,8 months ago,"Thanks Christian. I tried my best to share some honest angles of the phone. It is certainly thicker than the original Light Phone; but considering how much more confident we are in the device's capabilities (4g; headphone jack; battery) it feels like a worthy sacrifice. We've been walking around with these size (and weight) prototypes in our pockets and it's still significant difference from my smartphone. I love how it feels in my hands too.

The headphone jack was one of the reasons the thickness grew; and that was something we head an enormous amount of feedback from our Light Phone 1 users about. We really can't make the device much thinner without scrapping the headphone jack and I think that trade-off would hurt the usability of the phone for many backers. I hope these decision make sense; of course if you are no longer interested; we'll always offer backers a full refund before we ship - just email support@thelightphone.com :)"
I am so stoked about how this is shaping up!  Allow me to keep a bug in your ear about doing serious SMS testing with a variety of Android/iOS phones.  When I tried to switch to a Nokia phone a few years ago; I couldn't read half of the group texts I received because they rolled in as MMS; despite only containing text.  Also; I'm curious about how switching SIMs from an iPhone to Light2 will behave with iMessage enabled. Keep up the good work!,8 months ago,"Hey Rocky; That's a really great point. We are eager to get further into such kinds of testing for sure. One thing that we have on our side perhaps is that unlike the Nokia; our phone runs an Android and is in theory capable of getting all MMS and group messages. So although we don't have intentions of displaying MMS themselves; we hope that in all cases we can at least inform the Light Phone user that one was sent. In the future we might explore the option to forward them to email for viewing.

iOS and iMessage is pretty unpredictable for any device outside that Apple eco-system. I'm not exactly sure how switching will effect that; but hopefully I'd imagine you'd be able to get your messages as intended and they would appear on your iPhone as the green bubbles rather than blue. We can certainly do some testing with this and let everyone know how that works. If there is anything we can do to optimize that experience we're all ears as well! Thanks for understanding."
FYI -  I just posted our (belated) September Update. I didn't realize there was a character limit on those things; annoying! The update walks through our core user experience wireframes and touches on some of the account dashboard wireframes as well. I also shared this link - https://bit.ly/2Raiixm - to a Medium article talking more in depth about the E-ink screen and front glass. I'm not going to be available to respond to comments until the morning; thanks for understanding!,8 months ago,
I also agree with those not wanting to have what's app/facebook on their phone. If others want to install it later; stupid; but ok. I also believe that this phone would be more for people who want to use their phone the least possible amount; therefore the name. So what's app is exactly the opposite of that. Right now it's more social media than simple messaging with all these groups. WA accounts for lots of hours people wasting their time in front of screens. Sorry for the diversion in topic.,8 months ago,
The purchase price of WhatsApp by Facebook was around 20 billion. I can't help but wonder how they intend to recoup that expense. I don't think their methods to do so will be consistent with the mission of Light. Looking forward to the update today!,8 months ago,
@Timothy Lorens - maybe you should just get the original Light Phone or not take a phone at all? this phone brings messaging into the mix; whatsapp accounts for about 99% of messages to my phone and has over 1 billion users worldwide; so it would be a really great integration for some of us to keep in touch when required...,8 months ago,
I'm also super confused with the people leaving comments about What about <APP>?! We need it.  The idea of this phone is NOT to have your face in it all the time.  It's meant to be used as a phone.  I'd be extremely happy with just phone/text functionality.  Sure a clock/alarms would be nice; but are you going to travel with just this phone? I don't think so.  I don't want to be bothered by Slack/Discord/Whats App.  DIsconnect for a bit.,8 months ago,
"Oh I really hope that prototype is becomes more refined and doesn't continue to look like ""baby's first 3D printed home-made phone"".  The chin rivals Jay Leno.  That bezel size is completely insane.   The phone is the mock-up photos is WAY more elegant looking.   I really hope the final product is closer to that.   When/If you add more pictures; Can you add some objects (quarters; pencil; etc) to show scale and size?",8 months ago,"Will add some photographs for scale in the update for sure. I'm sorry for throwing anyone off with the process photographs; I thought backers would be interested in seeing the stages (not always pretty) that are a part of bringing a product from idea (our initial ""golden mocks"" on the campaign) to actual working final product. After the campaign; we went back to zero essentially; starting from internals before final aesthetic design which is where we are now. Hope that makes sense; thanks

Well; I'm hang'n in there. I'm excited to see the end product.  I think this would be great for my dad who wants ""Just a phone"".  I understand that you have to prototype and come up with a proof of concept.   I'm an amateur maker and dabble in 3D printing and micro-controllers.   You also realize the LP2 is a bit thicker than a S8.  Not sure if you're able to shave off more to make it thinner.

Wow! Thanks for all the photos and the Sept update.  Things appear to be shaping up!  The black on black phone seems elegant. Maybe it just doesn't look as sexy in white/grey.  Some say that if a car looks fantastic in white; it's body lines are absolutely perfect. :D"
How will we be able to transfer contacts from non Samsung Android? Also how will we be able to share contact info of one person to another?,8 months ago,"Contact syncing is currently planned to happen through the account dashboard (it's the website portal to manage the phone; either via desktop or smartphone; and I'll have a few images of that in the update). You can add contacts manually to the Light Phone of course; but the computer interface makes syncing a bunch of contacts at once easier than it would be possible on such a small device. Currently there is no shortcut way to share contact info of one person to another.

looking forward to seeing how it works in today's update!"
Will texting be in conversation view when the phone is held in portrait mode?,8 months ago,"I'm not sure I fully understand your question; and I think one of the images I put together for the next update might clarify this best; but I'll try to answer. Our OS doesn't have a separate phone & messaging app; so when you open a 'contact' either from your recent list or by searching; you are displayed a thread of your conversation history both calls; texts; missed; voicemail etc. That is portrait mode ( and fixed; so even if you turn the phone the screen does not turn landscape)...

... You are able to scroll through the thread and have the option at the bottom of the screen to call; message; or close the screen. Closing would return to the main phone screen. Calling automatically starts calling them and messaging would bring up the landscape keyboard for your to type a message. Upon successfully sending; you are back on the portrait mode contact page and able to see your new message in the thread. I hope that makes sense!

I am pretty sure you understood the question; and your answer is actually amazing. That's really clever; and I am super excited to get this device in my hands! looking forward to your update! (I am actually refreshing the campaign page several times a day in order to read it right away)Thanks for the dedication to this important project; Joe!

Great glad that makes sense; and that you're into it! I'm personally really jazzed about the OS flow too. I'll share a bunch of screens in the next update; but a lot of the pixel level detail is just now starting to get worked out; like the final iconography and grid (we're still using placeholders for wire-framing). Realistically I think I'll have the update out tomorrow.

Thank you!"
Hi;I've just noticed that as many others I have not received any updates from the campaign (last email was the order receipt in May). The notification emails are enabled in my profile page. Would you mind to check what can be an issue?Thanks;artur.,8 months ago,I'm really sorry that the emails did not get through to you. We've investigated it a lot since we heard from a few others and unfortunately whatever the issue is happens from Indiegogo platform and is out of our control. I'm glad you checked your settings; that was one thing they mentioned. Have you checked your spam folder? We basically just post the update through the platform and they automatically email all of our backers; we don't get to see what happens really. Thanks for understanding
Hi;Would you please consider the back light to be adjustable in a color range (warm light versus cold). I personally prefer more warm yellowish color while looking at the phone screen. BTW I'm really hoping there's going to be an app that would allow reading on this Eink screen (just simple epub reader with basic functions).Cheers; Artur.,8 months ago,I think that would be awesome if it were possible. We're actually in the process of working with our suppliers to understand what is possible; so we should know more soon. I personally am a lover of f.lux and warmer light; especially at night. If we have to settle for a fixed temperature light; which may be the case; we're going to try to find a nice balance white; probably leaning warmer on the Kelvin spectrum. I know how important the light will be to the experience! Thanks for bringing it up
Gotta say; this is turning out great! A lot of people seem nervous of some key features and designs; but I am so excited for this. I check back here often to look at comments and check for updates. Seeing the updates are promising and lead me to be quite happy with how progress is going. Though I am sad that updates take a while to get out..seeing as it is October. Almost November and no September update yet. However it is only disappointing to not see every small step I appriciate the hard work,8 months ago,Thanks Eric! I really appreciate your kind words and encouragement. I do wish were able to get the updates out more timely; it's mostly my fault; but there is just so much that needs to get done everyday to keep the phone development moving forward full speed without delay; and that becomes my priority meaning that making the updates get pushed on the back burner sometimes. I don't mean that as an excuse; I just think our backers would agree that prioritization makes sense. Hope all is well!
I cannot stress how important it is; just to me personally; that the screen edges be invisible by color matching.I know this is already a goal of yours and I appreciate that. Getting the colors right will make the difference between this phone looking and feeling really; really cool; vs feeling like one of those palm pilots from back in the day.Good luck; I'm sure it will be a great product!,8 months ago,Totally agree; it's of utmost importance to me personally as well; I am a future Light Phone II user and design nerd myself too :) I assure you we will do everything that is physically possible to make this the best E-ink front panel possible and I look forward to sharing our progress over the coming months (and using this phone daily!) . Cheers
Any ETA on when the Sept. update will come out?,8 months ago,"Hi Thomas; I was hoping to have it ready for today; honestly; but I'm a little behind. Definitely this week; maybe as early as tomorrow. I keep wanting to include more and more things in the update; but I think I need to just wrap up where I am and save everything else for the next update... Cheers

No worries! Just wanted to make sure I don't miss it. Naturally I'm just hungry for details haha. Keep up the great work!"
Is there any update on language support? I understand that the interface language will only suppprt English; but how about languages supported by Keyboards? As in for instance when I want to read/write some Chinese/Japanese messages; specific input methods would be needed and not just Latin keyboard.,8 months ago,"*specific input methods/font

Hello; I do understand your concerns and I don't have much of a tangible update at this moment. We have been hesitant to promise alternate language keyboards because we haven't been able to explore how difficult it will be (or hopefully not difficult) to include alternative keyboard options. We totally want to support such things in due time; but haven't wanted to overpromise which is why we've continued to say only English for the time being. Thanks for understanding!!"
You mentioned that you have been thinking about how to do simple Notes tool. The easiest way to do it might not be a dedicated tool; but using the messages tool instead.Have you though about what Slack do with DM'ing yourself? So basically you would just sms yourself. It would be great to then be able to pin a thread to the top in Messages. This would be perfect for me as I would like it for things I need to do later; or shopping lists; without having to remember a pen and paper when I go out.,8 months ago,"That's a great idea James; it's sort of what I do with my personal email (when I had it on my smartphone at least) sending notes to myself for later. Will certainly keep that in mind; thanks for sharing (that seems like something users could do without Light needing to spend any engineering resources on it which is awesome). Hope all is well!

Thanks for the reply. No engineering resources - I guess; but it would make a big difference with minor tweaks. For example; if you start a thread with yourself it could get an alias like ""Notes to Self"" or ""My Notes""; instead of the thread being labelled with your own name. It could also be pinned to the top or shown with a design detail so you can distinguish it from ""normal"" threads.

Great feedback; I totally see where you are coming from. Makes sense to me. Appreciate the really helpful suggestions; I think other backers would also be excited about such a simple notes idea."
Also I think it be cool to offer different charging accessory like a magnetic powerbank like fingerpow https://www.fingerpow.co/ or jiaguoe. just a suggestion. I like convenient and portable stuff. technically always changing and I dont like carrying USB chargers all the time when Im out and have to connect to powerbank through my bag or in my pocket.,8 months ago,Thanks for sharing this too! We might be able to explore future Light Phone accessories like various charging options. We've certainly had ideas for a bed-side or studio desk dock as well. Not sure yet what we will be able to offer or when; but glad to know others are interested in such things. Hope all is well!
Hi joe; I have another question while people may be disappointed with change from Type C to Micro USB. Will a third party magnetic charger work on LPII. I own a VOLTA charger https://voltacharger.com/ for my iPhone and its perfect and easy to disconnect without damaging the cord. while the tip stay on the phone. would you consider adding a add on accessory like specifically buillt for LPII; e.g Micro USB charger or magnetic charger. I know light phone will last for days. I think it be cool,8 months ago,Interesting; thanks for sharing. While I'm not personally familiar with this product; it seems like their product is relatively universal (so that their Micro USB product may work as-is w/ LPII?). I'm not sure if we will be able to make a custom Light version specifically; but if we find that lots of users want that we can certainly explore what it would take. Cheers!
I think it's important for people requesting apps like whatsapp; notes; etc. to remember the purpose of this phone. It's to use it as little as possible; basically only when you need to not when you're bored or want to. I strongly urge Joe and the developers to hold true to the idea of the 'essential-tools-only' approach they started with! I believe that idea + the aesthetics of the LP1 are what has brought you so many backers for LP2. Love that you guys have created this!,8 months ago,"Thanks!! While I totally agree that it's important to remember this is a phone intentionally designed not to be used (the value is in all of the other things you can do!); I do try to see how/why others may want something like What'sapp because they are able to communicate with international family/friends for free. We're curious if there is a way to allow that kind of ""free over the internet communication"" for those users without any of the bells and whistles of a Facebook owned platform...

That being said; we wouldn't want to ever compromise the core value proposition of the Light Phone ever; and as it stands don't have plans or an answer to how adding such a feature may even be possible to incorporate. Our focus is still delivering the best possible simple; respectful and beautiful phone experience we can offer :)"
I have a question regarding WLAN: Will it really be 802.11 A? The newest standard is AC. A has transfer speeds of about 50 MBit/s only.,8 months ago,I can double check with our engineers but I believe that was the latest spec sheet that I had seen. While I do very much understand the need to future-proof the Light Phone II as much as possible; 50mb/s speeds at a high level sound like more than enough bandwidth for our phone's needs and that's perhaps why we chose the A version.
I've read a lot of comments about the new mock-up designs so I don't want to unnecessarily repeat anything; all I want to say is a minor but incredibly important aspect of the original design the is the flat back and 90degree edges.  A rounded back is common on many phones and feels cheap imo. I understand that size and screen bezel issues are  a result of technical feasibility; but I would ask you to reevaluate the curved back if possible.,8 months ago,"Hi Martin; Thanks for taking the time to read through some of the previous comments. I also appreciate you sharing your concerns about the curved back. In all honesty; in may be too late for us to reevaluate this at this time without compromising our timeline. We made made printed mocks of the various size and shape options that were possible; with and without curved back and in our opinion the curved back really felt the best and we're pretty excited with how it's shaped up. That being said...

We of course can offer you a refund (email us at support@thelightphone.com please if so). We understand it is a design change that we made since launching the campaign. We made the change that we genuinely felt made for the best Light Phone; and appreciate your understanding of that choice. Hope all is well!"
Hi Joe; Happy Friday. Just perusing the initial video again and wondering. Is the plan still to only be able to type a text from landscape mode? It would seem if that is the case that you wont be able to text one handed;  Thanks for you effort and responsiveness.,8 months ago,"Happy Friday! Great question. Currently that is the case. We may do a test to see how texting might work in portrait but I'm concerned about the keyboard being too small. The Light Phone II is the width of a credit card in portrait mode; if you hold one in your hand now you can see what I mean; although one handed would be great; not sure it's big enough. Voice to text is something we can maybe explore in the future as a way to offset the need for two hands to send a message.

FYI I'm just picked up a Light Phone II mock and since our phone is not nearly as long as a smartphone it's actually not impossible to text with one hand while in landscape. Not ideal and maybe a stretch for some hands but not impossible. Thanks for asking and hope all is well."
"Hey Joe; you wrote the following a few comments down: ""he phone will ship will just the talk; text and alarm/clock and you as a user can manually add/remove the various optional 'tools' (directions etc.) as you wish.""How/where can we add things to the phone? Will there be an option to enable hotspot from the phone?",8 months ago,"Hi Ben; That is correct we have a core OS; which is the super simple phone functionality. There is a web interface which we call the ""Account Dashboard"" which a user would use mobile/desktop to change various phone preferences (like syncing contacts) to browsing available optional tools like as you mention hotspot; directions etc. Hotspot is a future tool that we plan to release; we are not 100% sure at this stage if it'll be for launch or soon there after. Hope that makes sense!

The next update (hoping to wrap up for early next week) will show some of the wireframes of this dashboard as well; looking forwarding!

Amazing! I'm super excited for this product to come out! Do you think that someone with limited programming know-how will be able to access these add-ins? Will they be free downloads? BTW I'd love to know your opinion on the following: The hardest part in going from android to LP2 would be the inability to get photos of my baby from my wife throughout the day :) Might it be possible to create an add in that allows photo messaging?  Keep up the great work! I believe in you & LP2!!

Those tools will be extremely simple to add; no programming required; just logging into the website and adding/removing as you choose. We want to create a Software Development Kit for those users who are capable of programming their own custom tools; but we may not have that ready for launch per current projections. While I totally understand the desire for photos; we don't think photos will work well on the Light Phone II and have no current plans to include them. Thanks for understanding!

Thanks for the quick response! Totally understand your answer regarding photos. Just to clarify - addins to the OS are free; correct?

There are no plans for us to charge for those; that's correct. However if say one of those tools is a service (like Uber for instance)  it may have costs associated with use (in that instance hailing rides costs money; but there is no Light fee or upfront costs for that feature).

Perfect thanks. You are doing a great job at providing transparency for backers. Thank you"
Upset about the loss of USB-C. That's a key feature for me. USB Mini jacks quickly wear out and will require adapters for most of the life of the phone as everything else I have is or will soon be USB-C.,8 months ago,"I understand Trevor that this change may be a deal breaker for you (or others). We can certainly offer you a refund if that's the case on your pledge (shoot us an email to support@thelightphone.com). While I do understand USB-C is certainly the future no doubts; it was a tradeoff (phone size) that we didn't feel made sense for our phone's needs. FWIW there is an accelerated testing that we do in which a machine plugs and unplugs a USB cord ten thousand+ times; so we do feel confident it'll last.

Sure; a machine plugs & unplugs... but that's not how it works in the real world. How many of those 10;000 times does it plug it in the wrong direction or at the slightly wrong angle? Thats when they break.

That's definitely a consideration; and I hope that I didn't come off as trying to prove Micro-USB was the same as USB-C by speaking about our testing. I was just trying to let you know that we are confident in our port's reliability. I am really sorry that we disappointed you with the switch to Mirco-USB; honestly. When we launched the campaign we genuinely thought USB-C would be easy to fit; otherwise we would have claimed Micro-USB from the get-go. This was not some sort of ""bait-and-switch"".

And the only thing we can do now is at least offer a full refund to any backer that is really upset by this news and we will always offer that; no questions asked; until we begin to ship. It's one of the most difficult parts of trying to ""pre-sell"" a product with crowdfunding before going 100% through the engineering process. Thank you for understanding."
Hi Joe!Will the phone be able to provide a Mogilner hotspot? This is huge for me since I use my hotspot for working remotely and connecting my car gps,8 months ago,"Mobile hotspot- typo

Yep; as I sort of mentioned in your other comment; it will not be a standard feature of the core OS; but something users can optionally add to their phone as they choose. We really wanted to keep the phone customizable in this way and the last thing we wanted was users to have unwanted tools on their personal devices. Hope that makes sense!"
Hi Joe; I think the point a lot of backers are making is that we all really hope that the LP2 is beautiful.  We all are happy to either ditch our current phones full or part time  to use the LP2. I plan to use the LP2 as my only phone. I want the LP2 over all other options because it is going to be a work of art; both hardware & UI/UX. It needs to do the basics beautifully and look beautiful. I want to feel great and a little smug about going light! Just a thought!,8 months ago,Hi Richard; I 100% agree. It's why I don't tend to disagree with critical comments regarding the design or aesthetics because it's vitally important to me too. I am a future LP2 only user too! I can assure you I want nothing less myself. I think we did learn a hard lesson with our original phone in that we put aesthetics over everything and therefore sacrificed usability too far. I think we have a much better balance of being able to do the basics well and to feel great about it with LP2. Cheers
Hi Joe. I know you are mainly focussed on the core functionality at the moment but I had a quick question about the potential directions tool. I was wondering if you were currently leaning more towards Google Maps or Open Street Maps. Also; if you do choose to use the Google Maps API; do you know what phone data Google may take from the phone? Keep up the good work. I really enjoy the updates and reading all the comments.,8 months ago,"Hi David; we've only begun to explore this detail at the highest level (because as you mention core function is our focus). We haven't made that decision yet; but that question of data will be an important factor to us as well. I will add that the way it'll work will be different than an Android smartphone with GMS (Google Mobile Services) which is to mean that it's not natively in the device at all; ever. The smarts for such a tool so to speak would happen in the cloud; meaning ....

..the Light Phone would ping the Light cloud looking for directions sending only the critical information (current location and desired destination presumably) and we'd use one of those platforms (most likely through APIs) from the cloud to learn the best route and to relay that information back to the Light Phone II through our custom interface. We are personally skeptical of Google and would not want to compromise any of user's data ever. I say this to assure you Google won't be in your phone."
Whats interesting about the Kyocera is its size.I really hope that you guys find a way to make the Light Phone 2 similarly slim - more like the mock ups,8 months ago,"Yeah we've been looking into it a lot for sure. It comes down to tradeoffs I think. Kyocera doesn't have the front light which feels essential to us for someone's phone. No headphone jack and their battery is similar to the size of our first Light Phone which honestly wasn't enough for our 2G phone. Our first generation Light Phone was actually almost a mm thinner than the Kyocera is; but we accepted making the Light Phone II a little thicker because we learned those lessons the hard way...

I'll share some photos of the Light Phone II in context for some scale in the next update; it's still really small :)"
I think I'll finally buy DoCoMo smartphone by Kyocera....,8 months ago,
Point of confusion:I think I have seen the buttons on the sides used for menu navigation.Why would we use that if the screen responds to touch?,8 months ago,"Good question. There are three buttons on the side. The up and down buttons are used to control things like ringtone volume or speaker volume. The larger center button is a dedicated ""toolbox"" button (toolbox is your customized list of tools). Because the screen is so small we didn't want to clutter with lots of navigation buttons on every screen. We think a physical button will help with navigating the phone and keeping the individual screens minimal. Hope that makes sense!"
Love the idea.Yes: Talk; text; directions.Maybe: music; ride sharing.That's where I'd leave it.,8 months ago,Thanks!! I'm really proud of the OS we've been designing. It will make it really easy to have your Light Phone customized to your needs and nothing more. The phone will ship will just the talk; text and alarm/clock and you as a user can manually add/remove the various optional 'tools' (directions etc.) as you wish. I agree with your feature list personally; and that is likely where I would leave my phone too. Cheers!
Did you guys see that? https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/10/17/business/tech/ntt-docomo-launch-worlds-thinnest-lightest-phone-november/#.W8fyIFzZWaNExcept for the web browser; it seems like it follows a similar ethos :),8 months ago,"Yeah we did; a fellow backer actually pointed that out to me yesterday. Interesting indeed. I am puzzled by the lack of front light honestly; seems essential to us. The browser is also not so light hehe. I'm really excited about our OS and it's design both aesthetically and functionally; I think it's going to really make the Light Phone stand out from other simple phones. Thanks for sharing and hope all is well!

I completely agree; your OS seems much better in term of UX and visual design. As a designer; I would actually love to start seeing some layout and visual design; even if not final :)

Will share some mock ups in the next update for sure! Was hoping to have a full walk through demo ready; but I haven't had the time yet..."
Similar to laxg; I'm a bit disappointed in the newest photos. I was under the impression the whole front would be the screen; but I see now the screen will be a tiny portion of the front with large chunky blocks of nothing below and above it. I was disappointed too that the front wasn't flat and seamless; but I see from the response to laxg that it actually will be. Going to cross my fingers and continue to wait and hope it turns out like I'd expected...,8 months ago,"Thanks for the feedback. I understand those photos might have been confusing and I really apologize for that. The front glass is 100% flat; there is no ""seam"" at all. It's going to be a really nice etched piece of glass that feels great (like matte). I'm sorry for any confusion about the size of the screen; we had a drawing in the campaign but I do understand that was not as clear as it could have been. Look forward to sharing our progress!"
Have you considered offering non-neutral colors? Also; I hear people asking for a lot of features; but for me simplicity is a virtue. I already have an iPhone and plan to continue using it when I need apps and stuff. Part of the appeal of Light is the ability to stay minimally connected. Further; Light is never going to be competitive with iOS or Android phones on a feature-for-feature basis.So this backer would encourage sticking to the less is more philosophy. :),8 months ago,Hi James! Curious what color you had in mind? We've currently just been really exploring the lightest and darkest shades of E-ink as to match the background of the display and body of the phone. Simplicity for sure! I totally agree; we do want to try to offer some optional tools and make it as helpful as it can be but there are some inherent (and intentional!) limitations to our device that will as you stated never compete on a feature-for-feature basis with smartphones. Thanks for chiming in!
Hi Joe;Awesome concept and excited to be backing it. I wanted to provide my 2 cents on the 'maybe' features:Borderline must-haves: - Ride-sharing - DirectionsStrong pluses: - WhatsApp support (saw this mentioned in other comments; I'd really want this) - Calculator (scientific please?) - Notes? didn't see it mentioned but seems like a simple and useful app to includeThe other potential features I could honestly care less about. At any rate; great work; excited to see the final product!,8 months ago,Hi Luis; thanks for backing our project and sharing your feedback! Ride-share and directions are the two most universally desired from the option tools we plan to explore. Whatsapp we definitely have seen alot of interest but it may be more complicated and take some time if ever possible (would require their support). Notes we have some ideas; but are thinking a little bit more like a note to future self (perhaps email?) because the screen is so small archiving notes might not work well. Cheers!
Hi Joe; I was just wondering where the screen light is going to be? I've read through quite a few of the comments and re-read the updates; but I can't seem to find it. Furthermore; will the light be colored; like the blue or orange glow of a timex indiglo watch? Or will it just be a white light?Thank you for your time; you're so patient answering everyone's questions and concerns! I'm excited for the future update.,8 months ago,"Hi Sarah! The way the lighting works is there is a piece of glass that sits on top of the E-ink screen and below the touch panel and on the side of the glass we have a few LEDs that bounce across that piece of glass lighting up the display. We are actually working on exactly how many lights and which color temperatures currently. We imagine it will be a white light; however; there is wide range of ""white"" light which can be warmer or cooler. Hope that makes sense!

Sure; makes perfect sense! Thank you for the prompt reply!"
"If the ""curved"" back panel on the LP2 seems very familiar... It's because if your into phone design or simply just have a eye for aesthetics; the ""curved"" back panel phone was perfected by Nokia for their long history of Windows Phones for Microsoft. The last WP called the Icon aka 929/930 is almost exactly the same design. Check it out; feels amazing in your open palm! The ""floating"" effect it exemplifies when lying on it's back is both an absolute marvel and quite a ""home run"" for Nokia.",8 months ago,"...the only gripe I have with the new design (as I owned almost every WP from back in the day when the Kin ONEm and Kin TWOm ran win7OS haha) is the fact that when I held the Nokia Icon in my hands for almost an entire year of use the corners were so sharp/hard-set that it was uncomfortable in a non-conformative way that no matter how it's held; the ergonomics simply clashed with one-hand-holding. Hopefully the LP2 will gain smooth edges in light of that very fact? I love the curved back but...

Cheers thanks Ian; interesting stuff here!"
I'm backing this and I understand all the theories on the apps (or lack thereof) but the one absolute killer for me would be to add whatsapp support; even if it was text only and no other media support in it; it's just the way that loads of people contact me and a good step up from sms,8 months ago,"Totally noted; and thanks for backing! If it were ever possible it would likely only be text and maybe call and in a very 'light' aesthetic; necessary for our unique screen. It would likely also require a pretty deep collaboration with them; so we don't currently have a great idea of how possible it will be at this stage or when it's be ready. I imagine as we have final working products we'll be able to start answering some of those questions in more detail. Thanks again!

yeah; that would be absolutely perfect; only need to see the text in the messages (calling isn't important for me at all; not sure I've ever used it!)if it's at all possible it'd be absolutely tremendous; sure it'd stretch your appeal a bit too!"
A few hours ago; a carrier in Japan known as NTT Docomo launched a few new phones; and one of them is the KY-01L (made by Kyocera); a phone that is /very/ similar to the Lightphone 2; which seems to cause the backer below @Hideyasu Ikeda; to mistook that phone as Lightphone 2.A few things I want to say/ask about that phone with respect to Light Phone:- Was there any connection/contact between LightPhone and Docomo/Kyocera when they develop that product? (1/2),8 months ago,"- While I don't think the general concept of having ""a small android phone with e-ink screen with limited capability and a non-special shape"" would be anything copyrightable; would light phone team have any comments about the design and release of that product? (Availability of that product is limited to user of a particular carrier in Japan so likely won't have significant impact against light phone 2?)- Do you think anything can be taken note from the product for light phone team?

Hmm; thanks for pointing this out. I am unfamiliar with the product; have just seen it upon reading this; and totally see where you are coming from. It does look very similar. It is not associated with the Light Phone. Honestly I'm not sure there is much that is copyrightable in the hardware aspect. There are ""trade secrets"" sort of like the special recipes like the paint for instance that we can get NDAs around with our partners and of course our unique interface is crucial to our phone IMO...

I think it's the reality we face as a super small player in the tech space; the risk of larger corporations trying similar products. We clearly hit an interesting chord with our Light Phone projects; so it doesn't surprise me completely. I don't think a corporation can as genuinely pull it off. In general I do welcome more alternatives; blatant rip-offs or opportunistic gimmicks are frustrating; but as consumers ourselves we hope to see to the landscape change and welcome other unique phones...

We'll certainly keep our eyes out for this and continue to see if there is anything that can be taken note; as we will with any other product we come across. Thanks again for sharing; hope all is well."
This product corresponds to Japan; but is the language English only?,8 months ago,The language is indeed currently limited to English. We would love to have great international support but as a super small team we are hesitant to over promise at this stage as we don't know how difficult it will be to convert our custom interface for other languages. The device itself is compatible of getting service in Japan; but the language for the time being in limited to English. Thank you for understanding!
"The images that you provided to Frank Conti are really nice. Like you said; I think the ""curve"" is most comparable to a MBP case. I'm looking forward to the added comfort.",8 months ago,Thanks!!
Joe thanks for the additional images you've been providing; it's very helpful to see where you guys are going along with your reply's below. This image in particular is pretty slick looking; so much so I'm thinking of changing my color choice to black. Thanks again for the continuing feedback!https://bit.ly/2Eppowt,8 months ago,Cheers; my pleasure Chad!
I know we frown upon discussions of other products (thus I won't discuss the new Palm secondary phone ;-); but FWIW Amazon's new Kindle has a seamless front panel... which is also similar to what I counted on (based on mockups) when I contributed.  https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17981684/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-update-new-waterproof-thinner-lighter-oasis-voyage,8 months ago,"Haha... I hope I didn't come off to harsh with that comment yesterday. I just didn't want to derail too far; where as this is totally sensible to me. I'd like to clarify something first. We keep saying ""seam""; but there is not a seam on the Light Phone at all.  What you see in that update prototype is a shadow (also a bad angle of photo). You can see the shadow on the Kindle too; it's actually more extreme on the Kindle; we've dissected it :)

I want to explain this in the blog post I've been trying to wrap up; but at a high level: the front glass has a ""stack"" of layers. There is the Eink Module on the botton; the light panel; the touch panel and then final the thicker outter glass for protection on top. The outer glass is painted on the bottom to hide the electronics around the touch; light and e-ink module. The gap in height (fractions of a mm)  between the paint and the screen causes the shadow. I hope that makes some sense!

All in all there are three factors in getting the phone to have a ""seamless"" look. Color (between paint and e-ink module itself); the reflection (the texture of the surfaces and how it reflects light slightly differently) and finally the shadow. These are three factors we're working hard to optimize and we've made quite a lot of progress. You can expect the Light Phone screen to be the best implantation of E-ink screen as possible; we're not cutting any corners. Cheers!"
"Hey Joe ~ Can you share your current thoughts about each of the originally proposed ""Maybe"" tools. I know you guys are focused on the main OS; but I wonder if anything is seeming more likely or doubtful at this point. Will there be a speakerphone? Can we take a call with the headset jack?",8 months ago,"Sure; Bradley. I think we want to explore a way to include them all. Directions is by far the most agreed upon and our priority. I can see us offering all of those in due time; we just don't have those estimates or exact feature sets yet. For instance music; may likely have a few options of tools for our different users; one would be a drag and drop music files player; one might be a simple streaming tool. We want to explore both when the time comes! ...

We plan to include speaker phone; but I haven't been able to personally test it on our final phone form factor to ensure it's efficient enough for me to list it as a feature. We've always wanted to include it but have been conservative in not wanting to overpromise. Yep; calls can certainly be handled through headphone jack; which is one big reason we added in from previous Light Phone. LMK if you have any other questions and hope all is well."
"I just wanted to know if the curved back will be shown in the next update. I am on the fence with this part; as I think others are. I would prefer a slightly thicker phone than a curve. I think we are fearing that it will be this sort of round ""D"" shaped device; but if it is very slight like an old Blackberry; I could get on board with that. Just a request for next update! Thanks for all the transparency. - Frank",8 months ago,"Sure! To be honest it is pretty subtle. Closest thing I can resemble it to is a Macbook Pro perhaps (bottom casing). I found a way to share links here to photos too. Here's a more exaggerated shot of the back trying to show the curve: https://bit.ly/2Eppowt  Here's a birds eye of it from the side; you can see how subtle it is: https://bit.ly/2J1YOZa And here's another side detail:https://bit.ly/2OxFPfa ... hope those help you get a better idea; LMK what you think? (*reminder they're prototypes)

They look great. I'm really seeing it come together now. Excited for update 12. Thanks for the pics!"
Hey; the progress looks great. As a light phone 1 user; the slight changes actually sound nice since the first one is so small it can be a bit clumsy at times. Not sure if it's too early in development go tell; but I was wondering if there will be a talk to text function with this phone.  Thanks; I'm looking forward to using this phone.,8 months ago,Hi Connor; Thanks! And I actually agree about the form factor; especially in the hand this one is a really nice fit. I don't just mean that as an excuse because we couldn't get much thinner with it. As for talk to text; we still really want to explore it; but it's not on our immediate priority for launch feature set; mostly because we are not sure how difficult it would be to implement well. I think it makes a lot of sense since the form factor is so small. Thanks for pointing that out! Cheers
Hi there;Development stages are looking exciting; however the specs and form factor dont quite live up to what I was expecting. Would it be possible to request a refund on my purchase; and how would I go about this? Thanks very much in advance.,8 months ago,Of course Andrew; if you can please email us at support@thelightphone.com
Hi Joe; really liking the progress. I just wanted to add that I am also quite sad to not see the edge to edge (or at least the illusion of) e-ink display live on to light2; as I think it really set the phone off astheticaly; kept the minimalist design; and set it apart. Otherwise; I am really liking the changes; but cant help but feel the new screenside(I know not final) isnt as appealing or iconic; but know compromises have to be made in some places. Excited to see the final design! Thanks!,8 months ago,Hi Michael; Thanks for the support and I appreciate the feedback. I can fully agree that we also want the phone to be edge to edge (or at least the illusion of it is a good way to put it!) and are exploring every possible means we can to get as close as possible to there. I'll have a much more thorough explanations what the challenges are to get there in next our update. Really excited to keep sharing our progress!
Hey Joe; I was going through other comments and realized that I have never recieving an email when an update has been posted. The only two emails that I have received are the order confirmation and first survey. I contributed back on March 11. Thanks.,8 months ago,"Hmm... are you able to sign into your Indiegogo account and see if perhaps you have the settings turned OFF for campaign updates? The other users I spoke with who did not receive the last update email did receive all of the others previously which I is why I suspect maybe that's the issue. Alternatively I would check your spam/junk folder? Really sorry those have not been going through; please let me know if you have any questions!

Ah; you nailed it. Somehow my email became unverified. Should be good to go now. Looking forward to the next update!"
Backer of two phones; but Im pretty concerned now with not only the size and design but the price. This is not much smaller than the iPhone SE which is also currently $250 (16gb) but has far superior materials and packed in more pricey tech too at that price point. Its almost 3 years old too.The added thickness (now thicker than any iPhone) for battery is a near deal breaker for me - why do I need a week of standby with charge ports everywhere these days? Rather a much slimmer phone.,8 months ago,"Hey Charles; I totally see your point. We simply wanted to make sure that users never had to worry about their battery ever; which unfortunately was an issue on our original Light Phone. We also don't have the benefits of scale and negotiations that Apple is capable of in selling millions of devices. Our price is high because we're a small team trying to build a phone from scratch and that's our reality right now. We appreciate everyone supporting our project; we're not a huge corporation.

I am really liking the size personally; almost more than the original Light Phone that was so small it was almost hard to use in the hand. I don't mean that as an excuse; thinner would be great. I think things like the AUX cord port and shorter phone made the thickness a necessary growth in order to fit everything we felt was essential into the phone. As far as I was aware; a smaller battery wouldn't have helped us with thickness much; just to help explain our decision making a little.

Hi Joe;Thanks for the prompt response. I completely understand the economies of scale challenge - makes sense; and as an entrepreneur myself; I would choose the smaller team because its certainly difficult. If the phone turns out like the original concept; I would pay double. But I may wait for the end product at this point. Thanks and keep up the hard work!

The plastic backing is the outer shell. There is still metal casing; it just has openings so that the antenna can more effectively get through. The SE you mention (which I actually use currently; albeit stripped to mimic a Light Phone II) has little glass on the back and rubber side slots for the antenna to get through. A solid seamless casing felt much more appropriate. It wasn't really a cost issue at all. I hope that makes sense!

If these points are a deal-breaker; we do understand and will always offer a refund to backers that are no longer interested (please just email support@thelightphone.com). It's sad to see our backers go; we are really trying everything within our power; not cutting any costs to deliver the best Light Phone II we can. We're really excited for April and I personally cannot wait to use this phone as my primary device. Thanks again for the support regardless :)

Just saw your reply; mid-replying lol thanks a ton for the understanding. Very grateful for the opportunity to try to make this dream phone of ours a reality and really hope that you do stick around to see the final result! Cheers"
I did not receive the newest update to my email...I have for all the previous updates; but not this one?And as everyone here knows; it was a BIG update to say the least.,8 months ago,"Not sure why this happened; we've sent them all the same way through Indiegogo platform. We actually don't have ability to edit that if we wanted. We've let them know of the issue and they're only response was to check ones's spam or Indiegogo email settings; which I don't think was the issue. We'll be sending an update this week and if the issue persists we will consider switching to another platform for sending the updates; ideally it'll all work and we can stay here in one place though.

Thanks for letting us know; Ian"
"BIG NEWS!  Verizon's ""Second Voice"" will enable us the ability to share a primary phone number with a second device. No; IOS user's imessages will not be able to be used; however Android users will be able to push text messages via an app. The price for this ""Second Voice"" is only $10 monthly; but reading the fine print will raise some cause for concern; as Verizon will bill you for minutes used for all calls coming in and out. Is this convenience worth it?(FYI it's $10 to just add a new line.)",8 months ago,"I appreciate that you are excited and sharing about other things sort of related (not really though); but I'd really like to keep this a place for conversations about the project. I don't think that's an irrational ask. It's not that we're ""afraid of competition"" or anything. This is just a place for feedback and suggestions for the Light Phone II. Thanks for understanding. If because of this news you are no longer interested in our very different phone; shoot us an email and we can refund you.

I might have been mistaken; if you are saying maybe this can be used for Light Phone II; I really apologize then. I mistakenly thought you meant for another product (the Palm phone thing). This might be valuable to our Verizon users in that case; thanks!

I have heard that TMobile and AT&T have similiar products as well called I believe Digits and NumberSync respectively (might be missing the exact name). All potentially great options for our users and around that $10 price I believe. iOS is a limitation always when leaving the Apple ecosystem unfortunately.

That is exactly why I would post this vital/crucial info Joe. I have been behind ""lightened"" phone experience since I had the option. Yes I am/was a 1%'er aka Windows Phone user until all updates were killed this year. Making me have to switch ecosystems to the bloated android UX :(

A refund? NEVER! I had the original Light Phone in white and am absolutely droooling with anticipation of the Light Phone II. Anyone and everyone with an ear to bend has had my two cents trying to persuade habitual smart phone addicts to sway from that DARK mirror and instead to see the LIGHT at the end of this congested social media world.

Thanks; Ian; I totally get it and am beyond excited to share Light Phone II with you!!

The new color option of grey is WICKED! As I will most likely switch my choice to this grey :) We've all owned white/black phones...But why so subtle? Why not go darker much like the ""nardo-grey"" that Porsche has started utilizing. I believe that this color will make for a clear distinction of high end class that the Light Phone II whole heatedly deserves. https://www.google.com/search?q=porsche+nardo+grey&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEucTekIneAhXRq4MKHcaABtQQ_AUIDigB&biw=1366&bih=664

The reason we are exploring that shade of gray is that we wanted to have it match the lightest color of an e-ink display; so we'd have the two inversions with light gray and black. Perhaps we could consider another grayscale color that would look nice in the future as well? Thanks for the suggestion. (P.S. the gray color is really intriguing for me as well; I was initially a for sure black version but now I'm finding myself changing my mind hehe)"
Hi; Just curious when the last update was? I realized that the last email I received was in July and I see an August update in the Updates section. Wasn't sure if there was an update for September or October? Thanks again!,8 months ago,"Sorry the confusion there; Joe. The updates are typically a month behind; so August is the last update which went out (confusingly) in September. September update slated for this week. Hope that makes sense; look forward to sharing our progress; cheers!

I think I'm tracking with you now. Thanks for the update."
Has anyone seen this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP3ak83ASjU&t=262s,8 months ago,"It's a Palm that is made to be an android phone for your phone...

If you have an Android device currently then you can use this Palm now instead of waiting until the (hopeful) April 2019 release date. I hate to promote others when I am/was so into the product development of a second Light phone but now that I've seen it; I can't help but feel disappointed; if I wanted a iphone4 with a downgraded eink display... well... yeah... who would? haha.

With all that being said: I am STILL keeping my fingers crossed and my hopes high; that these 1st promo pictures are far from the actual form factor that we are all waiting so long to call your own.

I mean; yes I have seen it. If it is more suitable for you then great; I'm glad there are more options out there. To me it's a just mini-smartphone; that perhaps works not as well so you are encouraged to use it less? I'm just not sure I believe their paid advertisements to ""live in the moment"" with a phone that has advertisements on it. It's a different product in my mind than the Light Phone II which I proudly can say will never have an advertisement on it. Hope that makes sense!

It's based soley as the LP1 was: a secondary device that is used when not wanting the physical bulk of your primary device. It's basically the same size as the LP2 but with a touch color display; apps; 12MP cam; and the web. I have seen a lot of these devices now coming to the market; but this one just has so much to offer in such a small piece of hardware. I only shared this as food for thought... encouraging the fact that small doesn't have to be associated with the stigma of being limiting :)

I see your point for sure. I guess my big hang up with it being for ""living in the moment"" (hashtag hashtag lol) is that I tested various ideas we had of Light Phone II by disabling my iPhone in different ways & I found that even an internet browser could easily be just as distracting as any social media app. By disabling all internet access (and camera actually) through ""restrictions"" in settings; I noticed a huge difference. Small and capable phone is cool! Not quite a Light Phone however..."
Hey Joe; Thanks for the earlier response and for taking the time to respond to everyones concerns.I wanted to confirm whether the final product will have the e-ink screen blend into the body like the original light phone?The latest update looks to diverge from that rather pleasing design with a distinct bevel around the display.,8 months ago,"Hi Michael; The original Light Phone did not have a screen actually. It used a customized light up fixed keypad to shine through a fully painted from glass. It was beautiful; but would not be possible for the goal of Light Phone II functionality (texting etc.). Our goal is of course to get as close as physically possible to a seamless design; much closer than shown in the last update; but I want to be realistic that this phone is a different design and it will not be 100% seamless.

The black version will be able to get quite close to this seamless design; the gray version is more of a struggle currently. The shadow from the glass stack is the biggest hurdle. I have a blog post I will share in the next update that goes into the backstory of the Light Phone 1 to 2 design changes that we had to reconcile in order to create a more usable functioning tool and what our challenges are in making the phone 100% seamless. I really do hope this makes sense; thanks for understanding.

Thanks for the honesty; I look forward to seeing how the design develops in the next update.

No problem; just want to clarify something that I learned may have been confusing. The Light Phone will not have any actual tactile ""seam""; it is 100% seamless piece of glass on top; it is simply the look of 100% seamless that I am referring to. What is perceived as a seam is actually a shadow under the glass between the paint and the screen itself and we've found some interesting ways to optimize that quite drastically. Look forward to sharing that work over the coming months!"
I understand that the look form promo video and pictures are not to be expected in final version of the product; but this looks like something totally different. I am fine with size; but round back and square front; are killing me; general design style need to be consistent at least;  light sensor placement needs to change or disguised better. Plastic; I am not a fan of; but I can live with it; if it feels solid. Sorry for all the negative; but this is how I feel right now.,8 months ago,"Hi Gio; thanks for the feedback. Light sensor can be better disguised on the black phone but it's not possible to do on the gray model. We cut it completely from Light Phone 1 for aesthetic reasons and really regretted the effect it had on user experience during calls. Unfortunately even white iPhones show the sensor clearly; so it's not a matter of having infinite R&D even. We tried to compliment the speaker and USB/mic compositionally working with our options...

The screen will try to be as seamless as possible; and of course the black version gets much closer than the gray version may be able to achieve. We loved the first Light Phone's screen-less front; but it came with it's own tradeoffs that would not work in the Light Phone II (fixed keypad and very hard to read screen; impossible almost in bright light).We will make this as beautiful as we possibly can; exploring every way we can optimize the design at any cost.

I do really appreciate the feedback and look forward to sharing our progress. The curved back is here to stay; and I'm sorry if that disappoints you; I will admit; it's quite nice in person; especially in the hand; and we've all grown to love it internally. I can at least assure you that if you are unsatisfied by the final product; we can always offer a refund prior to shipping. We will do everything to make this as beautiful as it can be; we are designers and expect nothing less. Thanks!"
Quick question.  Will it be possible to block numbers for calls or texts?  Sorry if this question has already been answered.,8 months ago,We do plan to have a way to blacklist certain phone numbers; thanks for asking Oliver and hope all is well.
hi; is it paird to our nomal phone or do we need a separate sim card?,8 months ago,The Light Phone will require a SIM to operate; as any other cell phone would; really sorry if that was not clear. However; many users plan to simply swap their existing SIM; others will chose to get a separate SIM for their Light Phone and some users; myself include; plan to use the Light Phone II as a primary device. Hope that makes sense!
I was wondering Is it possible banking apps will exist on the light?,8 months ago,Currently there are not plans to support banking apps; though it may technically be possible and something we explore in the future. Thanks for bringing the point up; if we find that this is something critical to the majority of our users we will certainly prioritize it accordingly. Thanks for understanding.
Are you going to release an sdk?  I would love to build an app for it.  Or would an .apk work?  I read it's running a modified Android.,8 months ago,We do really want to create an SDK and have accounted for it in our architecting of the OS and dashboard of the phone. As it stands however; it's not on our current launch absolute requirements; we are going to make sure we deliver a bug-free core experience as our utmost priority and future tools; such as an SDK for users; is next on our priority list. Hope that makes sense and really excited to see what our backers can create!
Hello; is the light team is still issuing contribution refunds to those who want them? If so; I would like one; please. I think you guys are doing a great job! I am only uninterested in getting a new cellular device.,8 months ago,sure; it's sad to see our backers go of course; but we can refund you if you email us support@thelightphone.com
Ah; and a German keyboard would be really important. I think a lot of Europeans see it the same way as we're having different letters as well.    ...,8 months ago,
"Biggest respect to you Joe for staying calm and polite! I would really like to make sure that there is no what's app on the phone pre-installed. I don't want facebook to have anything on my light phone. That would be really; really important to me. I mean if anyone wants to install it later; ok. (In my opinion ""going light"" means that I don't want any social media or messenger except for sms on the phone. Luckily I don't need to understand everyone here.) Looking forward to the update!",8 months ago,Hi Zeki; Nothing will be preinstalled; can firmly guarantee that of course! The phone will ship with our core operating system (phone and alarm) and every additional feature; for which whats app may never actually be an option because it would require a lot of support from their team; would be an optional install. Thanks!
For me; too. No Notification of the last update...,8 months ago,"Thanks for letting us know and we're sorry that happened. We actually don't know why that is; but we've let Indiegogo as it all automated through the platform. We simply post the update and it automatically emails all of our backers; we don't have a chance to touch that list actually; which is annoying because some backers want to change their email. We'll be sending an update by end of next week so keep an eye out for that; hopefully it will send smoothly as it has in the past.

If for some reason; it's an issue again we could try look into switching to a third party like Mailchimp; but we really like keeping the updates and comments all on the same campaign page. Hope all is well!"
Hi Joe - add me to the list of backers who didn't receive an email notification of the last update. I'm using the same address I left with the pledge; the message didn't go to junk mail; and all the previous communications Light Phone has sent (notifications of updates  & replies to my comments) have showed up in my inbox without issue. If you wouldn't mind checking this out; that would be much appreciated. I'm very excited about this project and don't want to miss out! Thanks very much!,8 months ago,Hi Christine; thanks for also pointing that out. The emails are sent directly from Indiegogo platform so we let them know of the issue. They mention it could have gone to spam; which it appears it hasn't. They also mention checking your personal email preferences of your Indiegogo account; but seeing as you got the other updates that doesn't seem likely either. We don't get stats on opens/bounces either. We'll be sending an update by end of next week; let's see if it goes through; thanks!
Joe; just read through some of the other comments over the last week or so and wanted to thank you for staying cool even in the face of negative criticism; which isn't always easy. The reaction to the prototypes reminds me of why video game developers are so reluctant to show off unfinished games.,8 months ago,Thanks; Thomas; appreciate it. I can imagine how raw some of the early workings of video games must be; that must be a hard one to share and maintain confidence from the backers. I've always been fascinated by the process of things; and feel that it's still worth sharing the sometimes not-so-pretty pieces along the way because that's the real story. I'm sure it's relatable with anything one creates; there's an initial vision that's perfect; then you gotta start from scratch to make the thing...
Concerning Micro-USB versus USB-C: I found on the Internet; that companies are selling reversible Micro-USB cables. Just look it up on Amazon. I think bundling a good and solid one of these with the Light Phone II would be awesome. I heard some don't have a good build quality; so one with better ratings would be the best choice. Or we buy one afterwards all by ourselves.,8 months ago,"Interesting; I've actually never heard of that. Will pass along to Dan on our team who is working on our custom cable sourcing. We're building a custom cable for the Light Phone II to ensure it'd be built to last anyway. Maybe something like this will be possible; no guarantees of course; but I seriously appreciate you taking the time to share that! It'd be awesome I think...

Would be great.

We're definitely exploring it. I want to make sure there are no long term trade-offs like if maybe it has different stress on the phone's USB port; but it's exciting idea. I saw a preliminary study from our suppliers who are going to look into it. One minor issue is we did some certifications already with the standard Micro USB and those would need to be re-applied; not sure what the time/costs are yet; will keep you posted; but really appreciate the suggestion. Cheers

I just looked it up randomly. If it is not possible; then it is not bad. I really must say I like crowdfunding and speaking with one of the project creators gives me a very pleasant and happy feeling. Keep up this good work. I either way will stay curious on how it will be like living with such a minimalist phone. Your YouTube channel was kinda amusing; funny and intellectual; too!"
I didn't receive the most recent update via email. Could you confirm I'm still on the list? Thanks!!,8 months ago,"Hi Alex; Sorry about that! Indiegogo automatically sends it to everyone of our backers using the email they left with the campaign pledge. We haven't edited that on our end at all. I just sent you a private test message through Indiegogo; let me know if you get that one? Maybe because it sent as a bulk email to everyone; your email client marked it as spam? I believe the update shows up in your inbox as sent from ""info@thelightphone.com"" but I'll need someone to confirm that for me."
Joe & team; you have been great with updating & responding. The new pics are easing some minds I think. It is starting to look sleeker now. Still a little bit of a frame-looking thing going on with the screen that I know is probably the best it will get. I was wondering; is it still way thinner & lighter than an iPhone or Android? Also; what does the circle on the bottom center do? I think it kind of looks out of place. Thanks again. Hoping for more angles of the prototypes!,8 months ago,"Hi Frank; thanks! Weight wise; the current prototypes are about 75 grams whereas I just looked up the new iPhones are 177 and 208 grams depending which size; so yes still significantly lighter. Thickness; we're equal or a hair thicker. We might be able to reduce the color difference even more than in those photos (reflection is actually the issue) and we've been making good progress there. I'll explain the factors (shadow; color; reflection) in an screen specific update soon. Hope all is well!

Realized I didn't answer about that circle. That's the tentative ""home"" screen of the phone you are looking at. You would unlock the phone with the power button on top and then the circle would open the phone itself. The two step process; common in most smartphone UX is supposed to minimize the chance of accidental pocket dials. The circle isn't permanently there; just on that screen. Hope that makes sense! Want to share a more thorough walk through of current OS design soon too."
Thank you for all the comments you are posting. here Joe.I have a question regarding this photo you shared: https://bit.ly/2OhcDIQIs it possible to whiten / paint the opening for the speaker and I think proximity sensor white? Else the contrast is a bit to high for the white version to look seamless. It would be awesome to also have this single-colored look for the white version; like you showed it for the black one.,8 months ago,"Hi Alexander; Good question; I should have probably explained this a little bit better in the update (there's so much we can cover!). The speaker mesh could in theory be matched pretty well; color wise at least; texture would inevitably be different; but the proximity and ambient light sensor however need that color covering to work properly. You can see it on white iPhones; they weren't able to find a work around with seemingly infinite R&D...

For the first Light Phone we cut the proximity sensor for that very reason; and it unfortunately proved to be quite a bad user experience during a call. It was confusing and kind of annoying. This phone also will really benefit from the ambient light sensor because the screen is not always back lit. It seemed like a necessary trade off. What we've tried to do is balance the speaker and prox sensor with the USB port on the bottom; not visible in that photo; so compositionally they compliment...

each other a little bit. We felt that if the prox sensor had to be black; keeping the speaker black looked more ""right"". Also since the typography would be black it would match that; where as the first light phone was all white on white (not practical at all; but surely was pretty). Hope that makes sense! The black version will be the more seamless version in this regard. We're testing the etching process for the glass now and that might give us a few options for optimizing that window... Cheers

Thank you for your reply. It is okay; that you did not covered that. No one can do everything.I think it is okay for me; now that I know it is not possible to paint the proximity sensor white.The phone itself looks very good on this picture."
Can I listen to FM radio during disasters and climbing?,8 months ago,Unfortunately I don't think we'll be able to have FM radio on the phone; but I do really see your point especially in the case of an disaster. Thanks for understanding!
Oh also; if the screen looks seamless enough on the final product; I'd rather switch to the white/gray model! Looking forward to this,8 months ago,Prior to shipping we're going to confirm everyone's address and color preference; so plenty of opportunities to make that switch when we have more tangible examples of the final products. Looking forward as well!
Thank you for the prompt responses. I am wondering if I can insert the SIM card from my unlocked iPhone into the Light Phone 2.,8 months ago,Yep; we expect that's how many users will be using the Light Phone II. It's an unlocked phone; as long as the SIM is compatible that won't be a problem at all.
"Truly dont like the ""final"" design of the phone and it's not what I sign-up for.  Disappointed.",8 months ago,"Sorry; Patrick. We can certainly offer you a refund on your pledge if you email us - support@thelightphone.com. I just want to clarify that we have not reached a ""final"" design; and have only shared incredibly rough prototypes that aren't supposed to be accurate reflections of the final design. The process of creating a product from scratch isn't always pretty at every stage. Regardless thanks again for the support and maybe one day we can still share the Light Phone II with you."
I think you might have mentioned that the LP2 won't support pictures or emoji. Is that a final decision? I know pictures will look bad on it but it's going to be a hassle explaining to people again and again that my phone doesn't accept pictures or emoji. I'd rather take a picture that doesn't look super great but at least lets me get the gist.,8 months ago,"Hi Thomas; As it stands we don't currently have plans to include images. There may be ways that we can auto-reply or auto-forward those images to email perhaps. Thanks for understanding!

Auto-forward would be my preference; of the two. I wouldn't really want the phone automatically sending a canned message to people saying ""hey sorry this person is using a phone that doesn't support images."" I'd rather see some kind of placeholder; so then I can check my email before replying. Also; if it is possible to auto-forward; is there a way to maybe include the previous message or contact who sent the image or some identifier? Just envisioning if multiple images come through at once.

Also; quick question; any indication of when we'll see a UX-focused update? I'm really curious to see how you guys envision the texting interface and general navigation. I'm still crossing my fingers for no text bubbles: incoming messages as black (or white on the black phone) and outgoing messages as grey is my preference and would look really classy imo.

Hey Thomas; Great feedback thanks. Currently the default we are working towards is displaying an icon/notification to you the Light Phone II user that an image was sent. Auto-reply or auto-forward are next possible steps to maybe explore; I was just sharing them as ideas. I agree that auto-forward seems much more useful. Having identifier at a minimum seems important and the extra context with previous message is a good idea to consider as well.

The next update I'm working on now will have some more UX examples. We've made a ton of progress here and I think it's shaping up nicely. Not sure I will be able to have a full walk through experience ready this time. There are no text bubbles; no need to worry! To be honest even if we wanted them I don't think there is enough space. We've been finalizing the vertical height system for threaded conversations; it's been a fun puzzle to say the least. Looking forward..

Great; thanks so much for the reply! I can't wait to read the next update and see more about the UX. That's a relief about text bubbles; I get why they're such a common metaphor across texting apps but it's nice to see someone branching out and doing things a little more elegantly."
Joe- the links you posted in response to Lukas' comment do work; and they've set my mind at ease that you all are committed to releasing a beautifully designed product come April. Thanks!,8 months ago,Thanks Andy; glad that others were able to see those and that I have a way I can share photos without blasting everyone with a  new email update. Cheers!
Hey Joe; simply wanted to say that I have a huge amount of respect for the way you've been dealing with all the comments on this campaign. Your honesty and genuine passion for this project is a credit to everyone behind the Light Phone. Cheers!,8 months ago,Sincere thanks; Roy. This really made my morning; thank you for taking the time to write me this nice note.
Love the updates; so excited that I will receive this near to my Birthday. I will look forward to finally going light :) This phone has started to think about my life in more of a minimalist way; cutting the fat so that I only have the things that matter.,8 months ago,Thanks Max! That is really amazing to hear and totally inspiring. Can't wait to share the phone for you birthday; cheers!
I see Google Fi on the list of U.S. carriers you expect the Light Phone II to be able to support. That would be awesome! Fi is a great fit for the Light level of data use. I think right now Google requires you to use specific Fi-compatible hardware so you can't just use it with any old Android phone. Any idea how this will work?Side note; thanks for being so responsive and up front in the comments here! :),8 months ago,"Hey Abby; I see that we have it listed too. I'm not personally familiar so I just sent a note asking how it will work to our engineers and will keep you posted on their answer. I did a little research just now and it seems to me that it does require a compatible device for which I'm not sure the Light Phone II will be. If this was an error on our part; I really apologize and we can certainly make it right for anyone who was expecting to use Fi. Hopefully that's not the case. Thanks!

For the time being; I removed Fi from our compatible carriers (we're actually making a v2 ""compatibility checker to share with everyone before shipping... it's quite the research project for our team). Our engineers are going to further explore; but it may have been an honest mistake that it got included because our phone is technically capable of supporting their network; Google just likely won't give our phone the permission unfortunately. We'll address it when we know more in that update.

Serious thanks for pointing that out to us! Apparently others have hacked many types of phones to work on Fi that aren't listed as ""compatible""; but we wouldn't want to claim compatibility under such circumstances of course. Sorry for the confusion there. Hope all is well.

Cool; thanks for the clarification. I've gotten a Fi sim to work with a non-compatible phone before and would be willing to experiment; but I agree it's unlikely that Google will support it out of the box. Still plenty of good options out there so I'm not concerned. Thanks again!"
Was adding a camera ever considered?,8 months ago,"We considered it at a high level before launching the campaign and ultimately decided that we were not confident we could successfully pull it off in a way that would really satisfy us personally. Beyond just the hardware; there is a lot of processing required to make an image look ""good"" (subjective of course) and we just felt we couldn't pull that off with our resources. We were also concerned about space inside our tiny phone as well. Thanks for the support and understanding; cheers.

Thanks much for the thorough reply.  Makes good sense."
Thanks for these detailed updates.  It's fun to see the project come together; and to see the barest signs of all the work you are putting into this.  Plastic is fantastic.  The cult of premium is silly.  GPS is great.  Sure hope you can put Lyft or Uber in - the light life is better without cars.Let me join those who would lose a bit of battery life for a smaller device.  But I'm fine either way.,8 months ago,Thanks; Paul! A 'light' way to hail an Uber/Lyft still makes sense to us to offer as an optional tool for sure. A smaller battery would only nominally reduce the size and with our first generation we went for as absolute thin as possible; and even for a phone that did essentially nothing; the battery became an issue. People were worried it would die while out and 'light'. The last thing we wanted is someone worrying about battery life while on their light phone. The size feels great to me.
Hi Team. Are there any concrete expectations or goals for how the phone will look by the end of the development? Like even a best case scenario: this is how it will look idea? I know youve said that we want to get as close to the original goal as possible but for me that is a little nebulous and I still dont know what to expect... More pictures in this regard would be great and would probably set a lot of backers worries at ease.,8 months ago,"Fair point; Lukas; I can see how that is a vague answer. We have a few of those ""golden mocks"" that we've made exactly as that; an example of a best case scenario. We us them to show the various partners what our goal is more tangibly so everyone is aligned in getting to that vision. I can certainly share those photos. I sketched out an idea for an update walking through our current design decisions and illustrating more clearly what our challenges are for making the screen feel seamless.

Seeing those photos would be awesome! Where can we see the update that you have sketched out? Or do you mean that update is what you plan to share next month?

Sorry that wasn't clear; I just meant that I started a draft of it. It's a little side step from normal updates; more of a backstory of getting to E-ink; but related in talking about our current challenges. When I share it'll be using normal campaign update. Also FYI - The mock ups I am referring to above (""golden mocks"") do not use an actual E-ink screen; but are faked with screen printing; sort of like our initial campaign mocks. That's why i was hesitant to share them in the update initially.

Actually I can share some here using links. You can see we printed the screen color slightly off intentionally to get a feel for what it might look if we got closer to seamless but not perfect. *Mini Disclaimer - This is still a test; it was also a relatively cheap mock up and it does not use the premium etched glass we are planning to use on the final product etc...Gray birds eye:https://bit.ly/2OhcDIQBlack birds eye:https://bit.ly/2y9AT5TBlack detail: https://bit.ly/2A1RWIu

Let me know that you're able to see those... the spacing got messed up in my comment; I'm not sure how to break lines in these comments. I've been wanting a way to share more specific responses with images; so hopefully this works out; I think it'd make this more useful for our collective conversations in general. Cheers!"
Honestly dont know what everyone is moaning about! This for me is still an amazing idea and amazing project. The phone is still small; still light; and is going to be ace. The most important thing for me is to keep it simple. I think Spotify and such apps are going to be a distraction. Spotify like it or not is a feed it does feed you music and will distract you. I think calls; texts; maps; and WhatsApp are the only must haves for this project. Pretty please get WhatsApp going on this!!!!,8 months ago,"Hey Luxe; Sorry for my slow response and thanks for the kind words. It's true it will still be a very small and 'light' in all ways phone. I agree that simplicity is key and am really happy with how the operating system design has been shaping up. The biggest value of the Light Phone for me; is not using the phone itself :) Whatsapp I totally understand some users need; and we will try to find a way in time but it requires a collaboration with them to pull it off in a 'light' way on our phone

Thanks for understanding and hope all is well!"
We have now entered the Q4. Hope everything is going smooth and planned. Waiting for your next update light team!,8 months ago,
Joe; I appreciate you taking the negative feedback and positive feedback like a champ.,9 months ago,Thanks Mike; I genuinely appreciate this.
My fiance and I are looking forward to receiving our phones in April. We are also having our wedding in April so it is going to be a great wedding gift to ourselves. we are planning on using this as our main phone. The prototypes from the last update are a little scary lol. Questions1- Any idea if Google maps will be the map app?2-Will there be Spotify?3-will any smartwatches work with it?,9 months ago,"Hey! Also looking forward to sharing the Light Phones with you for April. Congrats on the wedding. It is likely that Google may support the maps/directions tool; however it will not be the Google Maps app as you may know it but a 'light' version. Exact details TBD. Spotify is still something we'd like to have as optional tool for users; streaming is easier than downloading directly to the phone itself; details/timeline also TBD. May I ask how you imagine it working with a smartwatch? Thanks!

Thank you. Yes streaming a lot easier than downloading. With the smartwatch; I'm thinking text messages; calls notifications and maybe music control.

I see; thanks for the response. I'm not sure at the moment if it will work in that capacity. The phone does have bluetooth; which may be how messages/calls could perhaps be connected; but I'm honestly not so familiar with smartwatches to know what is possible. Thanks for understanding!"
Prototype looks nothing like the video. not very excited about this direction.,9 months ago,"Hi Kristofer; I'm sorry for any confusion. The photo is a raw prototype and I should have more explicit in it's context. We showed the original Light Phone in the video in telling our story and I think it has confused some backers. We have not changed directions and are still trying to make the Light Phone II as close to the original campaign vision as is possible; within constraints of the technology that we are using. We are confident we'll deliver a beautiful E-ink; reliable phone

Joe; Thanks for the response. The update made it sound like the technology constraints had changed the design scope dramatically. Totally understand how different a raw prototype is from a final product.Can't wait to see the final product.

For sure! I'm planning to do a more backstory update talking about the backstory from Light Phone I to II design decisions and illustrate more clearly what our challenges are currently in trying to perfect the front glass stack of the phone. I hope it'll be interesting to some of our backers! Look forward to sharing the progress and final product with everyone. Let me know if you have any other questions"
Hi; can I get a refund? Thanks!,9 months ago,yep; shoot us an email at support@thelightphone.com ... thanks again for the support Hunter.
Yeuch; the latest update looks terrible. I was expecting it to look like the video - not some odd LCD looking thing.,9 months ago,"Yikes that's harsh. We launched the campaign with a vision for the Light Phone II; a mock up that we aspired to achieve. We then began building it for real; starting with the internals. In this process things are going to look pretty ugly of course; and we thought it'd be cool to share that process with everyone and really didn't mean to scare anyone with those raw prototypes. We're yet to work on the front screen aesthetics; but there are some inherent limitations that are beyond our control.

There is no possible way to have a phone with a screen with 100% seamless front; as much as we'd also love that. We tried our best to get there with the Light Phone 1; creating a custom light up display; but it was a fixed keypad and had it's own tradeoffs (visibility was bad; almost impossible in bright light). We can offer you a refund if you are truly upset; we never meant to disappoint anyone. I can assure you we have the same goal as we always have and are doing everything we can.

A side note; knowing that our phone has to have a screen (in order to have the functions everyone is expecting); had we gone with an LCD or any of the technology that exists; there would have been a big black rectangle where the display is when it's off. We like that the E-ink allows us to get much closer than anything else that exists to a design that can function as we expect and look as close to bezel-less as possible. I really do hope this makes sense; thanks for understanding our situation."
I agree with a few of the other comments here. The original sleekness of the phone was a major draw. Would it be possible to pare back on hardware (batteries; BT) to get the original bezel-less design and thin form?  Thanks again for all your hard work.,9 months ago,"I'm sorry for any confusion Mark; but the original Light Phone was a very different product. It did not have a screen; it was a fixed light up interface. The shadow around the e-ink display; which will be greatly improved from that very rough prototype you saw; is inevitable in making the Light Phone II. We want the same thing as everyone else in this phone; and are doing everything we can within the realistic limitations of the technology to achieve something close to a bezel-less design.

The size increase was mostly due to the space needed to properly have a 4G antenna. The original Light Phone was limited to 2G which made that size possible; but also was much less reliable because of it. The bezels light up display is something we are really proud of; but it came with many trade offs. It was too small for some users to read; and only worked well in specific lighting. Outside it was almost impossible to read... Thanks for understanding and look forward to sharing our progress :)

bezel-less* light up display... (sorry for typo!)"
Looks very nice. I have two questions.1. Why are you still looking to build the white model; when it clearly doesn't fit into the aesthetic of the phone being as minimal as the mockups? It kind of ruins the branding. Why not drop it and focus on the grey and black? If you go ahead with this contrast most of the 30% would switch to grey or black anyway. I REALLY like the idea of the grey model.2. Is there a deadline for contributions at the current prices?,9 months ago,Hi James; Thanks!1. We haven't finalized color decisions and that's a valid point. Once we get a little bit closer to the final aesthetic we'll survey everyone to see what people think. It's likely that it may get killed as a color option if too few users are interested. These were purely rough studies.2. Currently no deadline; but we will give everyone sufficient notice before the change happens most likely as we begin fulfilling our pledges.
Can't say I like the current mockup at all. I REALLY like the gen 1 package; smooth; slim; no obvious bezel. The current mockup looks like a 1970s calculator.  Just sayin'.,9 months ago,"I totally understand. Those photos were to show that we've got all the internals together and finalized so that we could begin the process of working on the exterior. The first generation Light Phone did not have a screen; it had a unique light up fixed keypad. It was truly special and we are very proud of the seamless front of that phone. It had other trade offs too though; it was practically impossible to read in bright day light. It would not have been possible to keep that design...

and add any functionality. The interface was beautiful but limiting in anything other than making a phone call. We put aesthetics above all other considerations with the first Light Phone; and it was not as reliable as users expect a phone to be because of that. In reflecting deeply and talking with our users we felt that there was a need for a Light Phone II; it wouldnt have that same aesthetic allure but itd be a tool that could change someones life perhaps if they were to use it daily.

I do hope that makes sense; I assure we want the same thing as everyone else; a beautiful bezel-less minimal and reliable phone  :) The E-ink display has it's own limitations too; the color; the refreshing. If we used an LCD; when the phone was off it'd be a big black box. We're working hard now to improve the front glass stack now and look forward to sharing our progress. THanks for understanding."
Is there a reason y'all opted for Micro usb over USB-C?,9 months ago,"It had to do the internal size of USBC being larger than Micro. Micro allowed us to keep the phone from growing longer; and being that there were no technical trade offs in terms of speed or charging time we felt that was the appropriate decision. We hope that makes sesnse!

I appreciate the quick response. It does make sense; although I would have preferred the USB-C interface. Thank you for being so accessible! I'm looking forward to April."
"I like the minimalist approach...a few comments/questions:- Size - hopefully keeping the smaller than iphone theme?	litephone 2: 95.85mm long x 55.85mm wide x 8.75mm thick	iphone XS: 143.6mm	x	70.9mm	x	7.7mm- Weight - like the trend	litephone 2: 80 g estimate (is this the new estimate with bigger battery?)	iphone XS: 177 grams- Battery life	litephone 2: 5 days standby and ""a few hours of talk time""; 500 maH (is there a newer estimate?)	iphone XS: talk time up to 20 hours; 2942 maH (est)",9 months ago,The weight is currently ~75g; 80g was an estimate; so even with larger battery we're still under 80g. As for battery life we've been hesitant to provide accurate estimates at this time until we can actually test it. By just calculations our engineers say that it could last over 10 days standby. Talk time we expect to be at least a few hours; there are a lot of factors like connection quality that will effect this from my understanding. Our goal is not have users even worry about battery
It was mentioned at one time that light might be considering offering phone plans in conjunction with the phone. Did that materialize? if so what price range does it look like a very simple calling and texting plan will fall into?,9 months ago,Yep; it's in the process of materializing for sure! We'll probably have options; a limited and an unlimited plan at least. Our goal is for an unlimited plan of $35 and the limited plan being more like about half of that (or as low as we can offer it covering our costs of keeping a SIM active on the network monthly). I'm pretty excited about the plan honestly; really looks like we'll be able to streamline everything nicely (porting your number easily; managing phone/plan in one place etc...)
Will Whatsapp be enabled with this phone?I can't wait to get it either way :),9 months ago,For launch the phone will be limited to SMS; but it is possible that in a future update a user would be able to connect WhatsApp. It would require a pretty deep collaboration with their team so that we could customize WhatsApp to be stripped down and 'lighter'. Can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you too :)
Hi; JoeI like the latest update. It all seems much more physically credible now.With the recent updates regarding the screen and the introduction of a new color; is it possible to change my mind about the color I chose originally? And if so; is there a deadline for the latest date you'll let backers pick a different color?Right now black seems really appealing in your latest images; but ideally I'd like to decide only after the design is finalized.What's your take on that?,9 months ago,"Hey Emil; Thanks for the kind words. We have always expected users would want to change their color and will give everyone the opportunity to do so up until we are about to ship them. We will need to confirm everyone's address and color preference as it has been a year since we first launched. You won't miss a deadline; we'll be very clear about confirming color/address prior to shipping!

In the coming months we'll share many more detailed images/videos of the different color options so that decision is easier. The black phone is looking really great I have to say. FYI for whoever is curious on what the breakdown is; based on the our campaign backers; black was ~70% of the pledged phones. Hope all is well; looking forward to sharing the Light Phone II with you!"
Hello Joe;  I've been a backer for awhile and have enjoyed following the comments.  I'm looking forward to a simple; yet user friendly phone.  Will you be looking for some backers to do testing on any prototypes?,9 months ago,"Also was wondering how things are shaping up for turning features on/off.  Will that be done on the phone or by connecting to a computer via usb?

Hi Lyndon! Thanks for being a backer! We plan to do testing with our Indiegogo backers. There will be a limited number of betas available; so we plan to find out who is interested and then from that pool randomly select the users of our beta. We'll likely have two pools for the two regional versions and that will most likely occur around late January or February; prior to our April shipping...

As for the tools we do have a pretty good idea of how that will work. Fortunately the phone can do all wireless updates; so no need for connecting to a computer via cable. That being said the phone will basically ship with core functionality and any addition feature would need to be manually added as the user chooses using the user dashboard (website). This solves a few things; but most importantly we don't want any users to have unrequested features on their phone! Hope that makes sense :)

Thanks for the reply; Joe!  I would have interest in doing beta testing; if the opportunity arises?  That makes sense for the tools.  I assume the user dashboard would be password protected?  So that this could be limited just like parental controls on other devices.

No problem; we'll definitely give everyone the chance to sign up for the beta. Exactly; that was one of our concerns. In structuring the dashboard; a parent could even manage multiple phones from one account and without being able to login; the child's phone would be limited to the core functionality (calls; texts; alarm). Looking forward to sharing the Light Phone II with you.

That sounds great!  Thanks!

Another question I just thought of... will updating the phone settings via the website require a data plan for the phone?  Or will this work on a talk and text only plan?  They are definitely more affordable.

The user would be able to also connect to wifi (there is not an internet browser when doing so; simply to do the update; sort of how a printer might connect to wifi but can't ""view"" the internet). To the best of my understanding; talk and text are actually handled as data on 4G network; the carries just brand ""data"" separately as they mean much higher bandwidths. So wifi might not even be necessary. The Light Plan we intend to offer is talk/text only but can definitely do any updates. Thanks!

very good!  This is getting better all the time!  Too bad April isn't next month!!:)"
Question on messaging: From a software perspective how will the light phone will handle group messages and message threads? I'm thinking how I can transition from iPhone to light phone as smoothly as possible. I'm sure that MMS messages won't be supported but there are some groups that primarily use text messaging to communicate for both work and personal that will be important to my daily routine. I also need a threaded view of messages to keep track of those conversations. Thanks for your time,9 months ago,"Hey Steven; There's support for group messaging. When you open the phone you will see a list with all of your recent contacts that you've interacted with. Sort of like message and recent calls combined. The group's messages will live in there; as a unique threaded conversation; similar to your current iphone. We can't however have iMessage support (not possible on any non-apple device). One note w/ group messages is there's simply not a ton of screen real estate if these are very long threads.

Group messages was a big pain point to all of the current feature/flip phone users we've been talking with so we really wanted to have a solution for that. I'm also coming from iPhone world so we are also looking for ways to make those transitions as painless as possible; but there still may be some friction points with things like iMessage. MMS messages won't be supported; currently our plan is to let the user know one was sent; but long term maybe allowing (or auto) forward to your email?

Hope that makes sense; cheers!

Thanks so much for the clarification; sounds awesome!"
Wow... the new update looks like 20 years ago. While phones with millions of features are limiting any interference in sleek design; a phone with only limited features has the original design interrupted to a point where it no longer resembles the initial intent. I can buy any number of phones for far less money and dumb them down myself- they will look much better. If Im going to be pretentious in my I have a dumb phone to leave the world behind attitude- the design needs to back me up.,9 months ago,"Thanks for your feedback George. I want to first clarify the context of the update; you were looking at very rough studies not at all supposed to look like the final aesthetic of the phone; I realize I did not make that clear. We're been working on the internals which were finalized in August; that was the point of the update; now we have a final mechanical layout; we can work to perfect the phone. It's the nature of the stages of building a product from scratch...

We started with a fake mock up and rough idea of the what was possible. We then dove in more deeply; testing antennas; sourcing every component and laying out the PCB boards. When you see pieces from this process; it may feel like an initial step back from the goal; but were now spending our time making this the most beautiful E-ink phone within the realistic limitations of the technology.All of that being said; we'll offer anyone a refund of course if they are not happy w/ final design. Cheers"
Hey Joe;Always nice to see another update from Light - and look; while these new visuals aren't 100% to my liking; I think that mainly just speaks to the power of those inital mocks. The intent of the phone remains; and I don't doubt your efforts to get as close to that initial design as possible. Fantastic work so far.My actual question was more to do with navigation on the phone; which I've detailed below;,9 months ago,"How are you expecting naviation (that is; actually getting around the UI of the phone) to work? On the prototype I see there are buttons seemingly meant for navigating up and down menus. In what situations would you expect touch would be used? This area is a little fuzzy for me because e-ink as I know it is touch based; but I'd like some more info on your approach.Thanks again for being such a communicative campaign - excited for the future!

Hi Nicholas; thanks for the kind words. We're super excited to share our progress; I think although maybe a little uncomfortable for some in this update and I could have done a better job explaining how rough this mock is (it's literally held on by magnets); in the end it will give a good sense of the actual process of bringing a product to life from nothing; which isn't gorgeous at every stage.  Will try my best to answer your question now!

To be honest; there is a lot that we still are exploring with the actual UI. We haven't gotten to the point of fully diving into those explorations; but we have done some studies of what may work form UI point and what is possible from a technical behind the scenes standpoint. The phone has a pretty great touch panel; similar to what you would expect from smartphones and it's pretty responsive. Our concerns are displaying live mapping and general means for inputting info on a small screen."
"Hi Joe; it's starting to become really apparent that there is grave concern about the new look. Is there any way we can see a rendering or projected look to ease minds? I still think that shell looking thing is hard to understand. We all like that it will be a ""dumb phone"" but I think we want the sleek design to wow our friends too. I think there's a lot of concern over glass being used; seamlessness; weight; etc. Its a crucial juncture and hopefully there is an upcoming update that eases minds.",9 months ago,"Sorry plastic not glass

Hi Frank; good point; we could have shown the other fake mocks that look much closer to where we aspire to be; and perhaps using those would have eased minds a lot. To be honest; everyone who sees them in real life; even at that stage; has been really excited so I hope that also brings some relief. There is no shell thing; just a piece of glass sitting on top of an e-ink screen; sorry for the confusion. I guess I should post some more photos prior to next month's update; cheers"
Hi;Will there be airplane mode?,9 months ago,yep!
Sorry to inundate with comments; but one last thing. Possible to have an option to limit which callers can ring through (vs. automatically shunted to voicemail)? Ditto text messages in terms of some working as push and others as pull. Just thinking about how the goal of less distraction without missing the truly essential might be easily accomplished.,9 months ago,"No problem; this is a great point; and what I see the value of the comment section being. We want to offer a variety of notification settings as it feels incredibly aligned with being light. We haven't 100% flushed these all out yet; but one question about what you'd like to see. When you want a caller auto sent to voicemail is that like a blacklist; like you'd never want a call from that user; or more like a do not disturb where a few people can override it and call through like family?

Thanks for the lightspeed (no pun intended!) reply. What Im thinking of is probably more like a do not disturb where I could set a few numbers (family; babysitter; maybe the CEO but nobody else at work...) that would ring/text through; and everyone else would not ring through (and end up in voice mail) and their texts would not be pushed. So; yeah; a programmable override.

Gotcha; that's what I thought you had in mind; just wanted to make sure. I personally had the do not disturb feature on permanently on my smartphone; so I totally see the value. I'm pretty confident we can find a suitable solution for you on Light Phone II. Cheers!"
Thanks for the updates; but this one has included a lot of bummer. I have to join in with the folks who are dismayed about how different the phone is turning out vs. the images presented as part of the funding campaign. Now we have what looks like a Kindlewhich is not exactly high up in the hip device ratings. I appreciate there are tech constraints; but weve gone from a gorgeous; thin; minimalist device to something that from the pics looks cheap. Take your timeIll wait for better.,9 months ago,"Meaning: Im happy if it takes you a few months longer to get it closer to the original vision.

P.S. I know this stuff isnt easy!

Thanks; Geoffrey for sharing the honest feedback. We have heard it loud and clear and don't disagree with that initial feeling everyone has about the design; we just also understand how early we are in the process. Most of the work since launch has been finalizing the internals; which happened in August. We have been now focusing on spending the next few months perfecting the design. I really apologize for any confusion that that rough prototype may have caused. Thanks again for the support!"
Hi!I was wondering about the keyboard; is it only going to be the english version? I am from Sweden and our keyboards looks different from the english ones since we have three more letters in our alphabet.,9 months ago,Hi Fred; At the moment we are only able to promise English keyboard support; but we hope to expand our international support ongoing beyond the initial launch. Sorry for the bummer news and thanks for understanding!
Hi Joe. Just a couple thoughts I had about the core functionality of Light Phone 2. 1. Will there be a way to block phone numbers - i.e. telemarketers or nuisance callers?2. When importing contacts; what fields will be able to be displayed on the phone? Will it just be phone numbers or will there be a way to store someones home address as well?Thanks,9 months ago,Great questions; David.1. We do plan to have a black list for blocking numbers. It seems like an important feature for a Light Phone :)2. We have actually been talking about this internally. For the initial launch I think it'll make the most sense for us to limit contacts to just phone numbers and a first and last name. I totally see the value in adding that other info; and maybe it will be quite easy to do so; but at this stage we are not including it in the first pass of the core OS.
Hi Joe. Greetings from Canada. I finally pre-ordered a Light Phone 2; having seen too late the original Light Phone campaign a few years ago and kicking myself for having missed the boat on that one. I'm very much looking forward to the LP2; mainly to disengage from addictive reward mechanisms that our brains dish out every time an email; social post; or whatever pops up on-screen. The clinical research is becoming crystal-clear: smartphones are not good for us. Thank you for developing the LP2.,9 months ago,"Hey Ross; greetings! Thanks for the support. I totally agree. Since we first began this project four years ago; the research has only been exponentially coming out and from a variety of angles of the ways that it effects us. I think even Apple and Google introducing ""screen time"" features further proves that this is a real problem. Can't wait to share Light Phone II with you! Wishing you a wonderful weekend; cheers."
A suggestion: I think a simple notepad function would be a nice addition. Something that could be used to enter text in a very simple way. It could be used as a task list or just to write down an address or something like that. Maybe it even has a reminder function? Just thinking of some way to stay organized and remember important details while going light.,9 months ago,"Hey Steven; Thanks for the suggestion. Notes/notepad function is something we've heard from a lot of users and think it is worth exploring what is possible within the small screen constraint. Interesting for me to note that you want information displayed to remember while light rather than the ability just to document a thought for later recollection (maybe the note would email to yourself automatically). At a high level storing/organizing on the phone is a little concerning with screen size...

Maybe it makes sense to have a 'reminders' tool; that does not need store and organize information to view later; but rather just gives a one time set notification. Thanks for the suggestion; look forward to flushing this ideas out with everyone!"
Hi again Mr. Hollier;If you could do one-off examples made in titanium or sapphire glass (proven to work in other phones like Rubin's Essential Phone); I might reconsider the refund.,9 months ago,"I'm also a lover of materials; and would likely tend to be a user that would pay premium prices for better materials. Titanium is a wonderful material as is sapphire glass. In our testing; a full enclosing metal casing severely effected call quality. Many smartphones have rubber or glass cut outs in the metal for this reason; but without much space or drastically changing the look it was just not possible. Even if we did change the look; it still was likely to be much less effective...

Perhaps one day we will explore unique offering like this; but at the moment it's not on our current priority list so it's probably best if we just proceed with your refund. Thank you for understanding!

Ok; maybe next time in the future! I'll just use the Essential PH-1 phone because it's the only one other than your original aluminum concept that met my requirements for high-end materials. With all due respect; it looks like a lot of compact Iphone knock-offs from TaoBao now; Shenzhen has a lot of phones that look like that; but not as beautiful as your original concept. It was painful to say this; but I think you could use my opinion constructively as a basis for future projects.

I wonder why the metal affected cell quality in your prototype; but not in other phones using Aluminum and Titanium...maybe they used some kind of inert buffer you could consider in the future?

Ceramic; and Urushi Wood could be a consideration in the future. Urushi is a Japanese lacquer finish; and will not affect signal transmission; it's integration as a phone has never been done before. I can understand Japanese; and can get you craftsman to make a Urushi phone in future.

Persimmon-Lacquer Paper is also a great idea. My dustpans are made of this material (also from Japan); and has been used for centuries for durable dustpans.  This is not a conductive material; and not absorbent; as well as extremely light; great for your next project. It could also make the phone less costly.

One more suggestion for a future metal design with integrated buffer material; a copper skin. Copper has natural antibacterial properties; my cookware is made of copper/tin (which would match perfectly); and would lend considerable heft to the phone. However a challenge would be keeping heat down; copper's heat conductivity is the second highest of all metals (silver being highest); and oxidation would be a problem without proper maintenance.

Thank you for sharing all of this super thoughtful follow up. We will miss you as a backer! I know for example on the iPhone I have (5 i think?) there are glass pieces embedded on the back of the phone as well as a rubber break in the side wall metal where the antenna can go out. If i block that with my hand it drops calls.  I love the sound of all these other materials; I'll run them by our engineers; maybe something will be possible after all. Sincere thanks for your time and support!

I can get you in contact with contractors in Japan if you like in the future. Drop me a line and I'll help you out in your next project! An Urushi phone would definitely out-style other competitors; it has never been thought of; never been done before.

That is incredibly generous of you; thank you for your willingness to connect us in the future. Wishing you best.

I have another good idea! Frosted Sapphire Glass. Same virtually scratch-proof material used in watches; and imitates the look of your original concept of matte aluminum. It's inert and not conductive; proven effective."
This project no longer looks like the phone I envisioned. What a shame aluminum was unable to be used; since this was used in many phones of today. The screen looks nothing like the original concept; now it looks like just about any other phone. USB-C was an essential for me; it is more durable than micro-USB and now that it has been downgraded; I must request a refund. With all due respect; the current direction has strayed too far from the elegant concept it was originally.,9 months ago,I understand your concerns and we can certainly offer you a refund of course. If you can please email us at support@thelightphone.com we can find a way to do so. Thank you again for your support! Although some things have changed; we've made these decisions very carefully and feel that in each case it supports the goal of a better end product. Aluminum casing will be missed; and is still supporting the internals for strength; but not effecting the signal quality which made more sense to us.
Greetings!  I'm pretty psyched about this.  This one big concern I have is the playlist.  I rely on music to augment my explorations and creative endeavors.  Could you explain better what you have in mind? Basic inter-operation with Spotify?  Just a manually downloaded playlist?  I don't keep as much of my music in MP3 form as I used to.,9 months ago,"HI Benjamin; Cheers! Playlist is still pretty TBD. It'll likely turn into a few options for our different users. A basic mp3 player for manually adding audio files seems like a nice thing to offer. We also really like the idea of supporting public radio streaming. Streaming from a platform like Spotify is also pretty possible; we'd want to flush out the UX/features with our users.  Storing a playlist from a streaming service is possible; but a little more complicated with DRM and copyright laws

Very cool.  I don't think public radio would be a feature I would care about.  I want to be able to control what I listen to if I am going to use this a lot.  I think the Spotify streaming would be best and allows users to use it at the gym/running/creating. It also has plenty of NPR podcast content on it anyway; I would hate a mandatory NPR app on any phone I owned; really.

Appreciate the feedback regarding public radio idea. Just want to clarify that no tool will ever be mandatory ever. I totally understand where you are coming from; and do personally predominantly listen to Spotify myself. I did like that with public radio (npr or other local stations) that users wouldn't be locked to needing a subscription to a particular platform; and the chance for random new discoveries might be a nice thing to try for me since I can easily stay in my music bubble. Cheers!

That's interesting and I see your point.  Spotify has a free version; and I feel like a predominantly discover new music on Spotify while NPR/public radio is pretty limited in what they play; plus endless money raising marathons.  I think most importantly is that with a radio channel like NPR; you can't avoid the news.  And when I look to ""disconnect"" I look to avoid news at all costs.  Thanks for listening.

Ah totally! Didn't even think of that honestly. News is quite the drag; I would not want that either. I guess I quickly thought the music stations could be cool. We haven't spent time to fully consider the radio yet; so thanks for bringing up that point. Likewise; a free Spotify would have advertisements which for me is a huge red line. If there is one thing I personally am moved by with the project it's that the phone will never have an advertisement...

Spotify premium streaming could still work in my opinion. There will still be the option of freely installing one's own songs/podcast like an iPod shuffle of course."
Gosh you do a lot of comment responding; Light Team. Thanks for your hard work with keeping us updated and creating such an interesting device. Just have a question and some comments that may help others that I hope you can answer and address;,9 months ago,"Im a New Yorker (too!) currently living in Taiwan and traveling frequently with a T-Mobile international plan. Therefore; I enjoy and require world phone capabilities. While I can see the different LTE bands the two different phones will have; my US plan allows me to use 2G when abroad. What other frequencies does the board support? Will a US A version work in a B region 2G band and vice versa? (Sorry if this will be addressed soon. Disregard this if thats the case).

Part of the reason I like this phone is not only the simplicity and beautiful design; but also the fact that it should respect my privacy. While Im a little bummed that the phone is running Android; I understand why it was necessary. I just hope that when the time comes for developing directions and other apps; you try to avoid using information collecting companies.

There are some benefits to Android; though. Since it is running the OS; I do hope that the community and myself will have the ability to develop our own simple apps with downloadable apks without the need for Google play services.Sorry for the long winded response. Thanks for your time.

Cheers; it's a lot of work; but it's really important to me to keep everyone in the loop as to what's going on and why. I learn a lot from the feedback and we take it seriously into our decision making. At the end of the day; I think we all want the same thing; a beautiful simple quality phone; so even when the feedback is critical I often don't disagree. We unfortunately do sometimes run face first into reality (things beyond our control) and there are tradeoffs that need to happen at times...

I totally understand your global phone needs; and unfortunately may not have great answers for you. I know the 2G fallback you are referring too; and will need to double check but believe that we do not have that capability. The two versions may overlap with some regions with varying degrees of reliability; but generally they are not cross compatible. We really did try to fit all of the bands into one model; but it proved not possible. Im sorry for this news...

We seriously respect our users privacy; and a user myself I find that also an important aspect to our phone. We are licensing Android which helps with some of the core dialer functionality and saved us a lot of development costs in trying to do so from scratch. We are not interested in or willing to collect or share user data. As other tools come out as options; privacy concerns and our transparency around user data handling will be a critical part of our designing process...

We also look forward to opening up the phone to custom development through a Light SDK. It's our plan to offer this; we just don't have it on the timeline yet. We have to flush out those details still before we understand when that will be available; thanks for understanding!"
"I didn't see a spec on weight in this update. Please get this as close to your initially listed 85g/3oz; that is honestly bada$$! I'm worried with the now doubled battery size. Please (try to) Keep it LIGHT! Loving the dimensions; and looks of the prototype. Very excited! Oh one other thing; the philosophy of why a ""light"" phone need 4g/LTE? NO browser; email; downloading photos. 3g would be plenty fast for my needs (10mbps on my network) on a non internet based phone?",9 months ago,"Hi Bradley; Will try to get an updated spec on the weight; I'm not sure at the moment; good point. Interesting side note about weight; the little mocks we have have weights taped inside and they are much heavier than the 85g and people to my surprise who pick it up comment on how they love the heft of it. I tend to agree in wanting it to be lighter.

As for 3G; we did consider it but honestly from our early talks with carriers to ensure we where building a phone that was future proof; it appears that 3G is about to be sunset in the US (mostly to make room for 5G). Also I will add that I did some pretty thorough testing with the Nokia 3310 myself in NYC for a decent few weeks and the coverage was rather disappointing. That's why we went with 4G; it seemed to make the most sense even though we won't really be utilizing it's full potential.

Thank you Joe; I forgot about new network tech; we need need driverless cars (5g)! Heft in the hand is fine; heft in my front pocket feeling like a lead brick sucks!

Haha that's a good way to think about it actually! We definitely won't add weight for the sake of it. I do agree with that statement though; heavy pockets is a drag.

Hey Bradley; Just wanted to follow up here about our current weight estimate. Currently the engineers are projecting it's about 75g. Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead; cheers!"
Really excited about the update; everything is looking great! I understand this request may be a long shot; but I was wondering if I could get a few small samples of the finished plastic you are using once the design has been finalized. I have a small co2 laser cnc machine and I would love to experiment with engraving designs into the back of my phone; but I know the specific properties of the material can dramatically impact this. I would rather test on a small sample than the actual phone.,9 months ago,"Hi Thomas; Thanks! That actually might not be such a long shot; however it won't be ready for a few months at least. In our timeline we started with the internals of the hardware and puzzling them into a form factor we liked and that allowed the phone antennas to function effectively. We are just now diving into the nuances of painting; coating; and finessing every detail of the phone; which for our first phone took many months. If you can please remind me early next year that would be great.

Awesome; that's great to hear! I definitely understand that it will be a while before anything is available; I'll remind you again in a few months after the final design has been revealed and I've made my final color choice.Keep up the great work!"
Hey Joe; I just wanted to say how much I've appreciated your transparency and clear level of communication with everyone. It's definitely keeping me excited as a backer.,9 months ago,Thanks! That makes me really happy to hear. I feel personally blessed to even have this opportunity honestly. I want nothing more than to exceed everyone's expectations in bringing this phone to life. Hope that all is well! Can't wait for April...
I don't think people understand that the front of the entire phone will be one piece of glass and that the display area may just sit back a few millimeters out of necessity to accommodate the front/side light. I was also confused by this until your note to W. Hayes this morning. I had thought I was going to be getting pocket lint around the perimeter of the display LOL. I think your product is going to work similar to the Kindle Oasis as opposed to the Kindle Paperwhite and this makes me happy!,9 months ago,"I'd like to request settings that allow the user to invert the home screen and lock screen separately.

Hi Bradley; I think I should do an update focusing on just how the stacking of the screen; touch; light and glass all work. It's actually only fraction of a millimeter; but still will create a noticeable shadow if not really cleverly considered. I should also share photos of the black model in which the seam even at this raw stage looks much less noticeable. I wanted to share the raw process mocks; which isn't as pretty as the final product or the initial mock up. Hope this makes sense!"
jeez...in addition to the simplicity of use; the aesthetic really was a big deal for me - the display seemingly seemlessly formed across the front surface of the device; or at least having the visual appearance of doing so; definitely pulled me in. with this recent update; it appears that was likely a photoshop pipedream at best - truly for conceptual purposes...thats all. in the words of the tangerine...sad,9 months ago,"Arn; thank you for the feedback. I want to assure you that we are completely aligned in that prioritization of aesthetics. In reflecting on the original Light Phone; in which aesthetics took priority to literally everything; including function and reliability; we hope to find a more suitable balance (beautiful phone that you can count on to work). Our perfectly seamless front of the original Light Phone made us so proud and our goal still is to get as physically close to that as possible...

The image shown was not really aesthetically considered at this stage. These were hand made; held on by magnets so that I could swap them between other protos and test the UX sizing and placement relative to holding the phone in my hand. There are a lot of steps we are currently taking and it will improve greatly! I should have shown the black version in the update as that already at this raw stage looks much closer to the initial seamless mocks; although it will too improve through development.

Hope that makes sense; cheers!"
I am sorry if it is difficult to communicate because I use translation.In the visual published at this update; I was discouraged witnessing the gray e-ink display floating on the white body.It was because I was touched by the beauty of the letters floating on the pure white body I first saw.But I'm still expecting it because I promised to do color adjustment at a level where I can not limit the boundary between the front panel and the display in the next step.Please do your best.,9 months ago,Hi Shingo; The translation works; I understand where you are coming from. Through the process of bringing a product to life; there are stages; and not every stage is as beautiful as you'd aspire to achieve with the final product. It's great to take everyone with us through that journey and we don't want to discourage anyone with the last update photos. We're already working hard to make the contrast between the display and panel as minimal as possible and look forward to sharing our progress!
when talking about the seam around the screen; do you mean that there will be an indent; like with something like the Kindle; or will it be completely flat; akin to something like the iPhone (I know the iPhone is completely different to this phone; I just thought it would be a good example of a screen that doesn't have an indent for the usable part)thanks!,9 months ago,Hi William; The surface will be a completely flat piece of glass (yes similar to smartphones). The E-ink module sits below this glass and what we are currently working on is trying to minimize as much as physically possible the contrast between the E-ink module and the painting of the glass so that it appears seamless to the rest of the front glass. It's quite similar to how a smartphone screen sits as well. Hope that makes sense!
Hi teamI am sorry to tell you this but due to many hardware changes; I would like to refund it.Thank you,9 months ago,We can certainly offer you a refund. Will you please email support@thelightphone.com with your backer number. FYI There have not been any significant hardware changes; I'm sorry to hear that you are no longer interested in the Light Phone II. We seriously appreciate your support of our campaign; thanks.
Hey all; first I need to say that your monthly updates and commitment to transparency are admirable. It's unfortunately rare in most industries; and I applaud you for the effort you've put forth.Knowing that you're switching to Micro USB instead of USB Type-C is disappointing. A large part of why I wanted this phone was to get away from the complexity of having a different charger for my computer and phone. It's a deal breaker for me; and I'm hoping you can refund my purchase.Thanks!,9 months ago,Sorry for the disappointing news about the port change; we made the decision that we thought made the most sense for the final product and understand that may not be true for every single user. Yes we can of course offer you a refund if you please email us at support@thelightphone.com (Indie doesn't allow refunds directly through the platform). Thanks again for the support; seriously means so much to us!
One question I have is with regards to the front face of the phone. In the promotional video and the pictures which we can scroll through alongside it (the first thing you see at the top of this page); the seam of the screen blends straight into the edges of the phone. That aesthetic appealed to me greatly. The demo pics from the update seem to show the screen blatantly contrasting to the housing plastic. Ive seen comments regarding seamlessness; but what should we expect in this regard?,9 months ago,Thanks Lukas; will try my best to answer clearly. The photographs from the campaign were mock ups; and the seamlessness was indeed appealing; and it is our goal to get as close to that as possible. We are in the process of trying various techniques to minimize the contrast and shadow as much as possible; and we expect it will look much better than the prototypes from the update; however it may not be possible to get it as 100% seamless as the initial mock ups shown. Hope that makes sense!
Thanks for the August update. Design-wise I'm going to trust the process. Really liking the idea of the third colour scheme. And a bigger battery is welcome! In your estimation; how does 1-2 week standby time translate to daily use?Also; will the 8gb internal be expandable by SD? Not that I'll likely need it but just curious. Apologies if these questions have already been asked.,9 months ago,"Hey Alex; thanks! I'm a little hesitant to estimate it at this time; but purely guessing; considering that users aren't going to be scrolling for hours a day; it should last at least a few days(more than three). The E-ink conserves battery during the day; night use with light will drain more. Lots of long calls will also drain more significantly; but we really don't want battery life to be something users have to worry about day in and day out...

I'm hoping in day to day use it exceeds a week honestly; but until we can prove it; I'm hesitant to say that firmly. Hope that makes sense. There is not an SD card slot in the phone itself. It may be possible if we find that our users need more space to find a clever case solution with expandable memory but currently we don't have plans yet for such an accessory. Thanks for understanding and no problem repeating questions; let me know if you have any others.

Thanks for your reply. Makes sense! Honestly anything more than 24 hours will be great compared to most phones today."
Thanks for the update!  I like how things are shaping up.  The prototype looks good and I was really pleased to read about the larger battery.  As long as reception and audio quality are good; I think you have a winner.  Keep up the good work!,9 months ago,Cheers thanks for the support Oliver.
Very exciting August Update. Would like a photo of someone holding the new external design (for a practical sense of size).Also; I saw someone say we *need* USB-C and that will future proof it. Wanted to respond that it doesn't seem like the world is actually switching to USB-C all that fast (we're just in dongle hell; what other peripherals are actually using it?) and plenty of devices are still using a Micro USB; so it's a fine design choice.,9 months ago,Thanks Joseph; we're pretty excited as well with how things are shaping up. Will share photos with scale/context for sure; hard to tell with the blank paper background. I'm loving the size; shape of the phone; been bringing one around with me in my pocket and am excited to really start using the thing! I tend to agree re:USB; not that I love MicroUSB over USB C; but I actually currently don't have any USB-C devices or cords (which I imagine will change when I upgrade my computer one day).
There may be no applicable hardware benefits of going with USB-C (like faster charging; higher data transfer speeds; etc); but going with Micro USB will just make it feel stuck in the past; whereas using USB-C basically future-proofs the phone. I feel very strongly about this and almost asked for a refund because of it.,9 months ago,While that is true; USB C is capable of higher data and faster charging than Micro USB; it would not have actually been true for the Light Phone II which does not require high speed data transfers ever. We ensured that the charging speeds maintained as that may be critical for using the phone while plugged in (maybe directions). Feeling stuck in the past; that's a valid point; but the trade off would have been a longer phone and most likely a timeline delay. I'm sorry for the disappointing news.
So hello - I am a back and have been watching the phone as it progresses. Unfortunately; I've not been included in any of the surveys. What should I do to ensure that I have a phone coming my way and that I can be more of a part of the survey process that seems to be going on? Thanks,9 months ago,Hi Kristin; We sent one initial survey and I'll forward that along now. Backers who joined the campaign after the survey was sent initially unfortunately don't automatically get it; but you will automatically get all future surveys (as will any new backers). Hope this makes sense and excited to have you as a part of the process.
One of the questions the prototype conjures is RE: the side-lighting. Even if the blending is v. good (I'd say YotaPhone sets the standard; as pointed out in past comments); I'm curious how the lighting will work. The prototype seems to suggest that only the active display area would get lit. Is that the case; or are you looking to give the entire front glass a glow as to maintain the illusion of a seamless display?If the former; do you have any indication of how good (or bad) that looks?,9 months ago,"HI Jeffrey; Good point about lighting that maybe isn't as obvious; but you are correct the current plan is that just the active are would be lit up. This is what we're currently working on; so I don't have any tangible examples to share; but I'm relatively optimistic about it. I don't think the lack of seamlessness when in such low light will feel wrong in any way; I hope that makes sense and look forward to sharing our progress with these!

Hi; Joe. Thanks for the response. Truthfully; I think you're right: in the dark I'm not going to be admiring the body of the phone; so whatever seams it illuminates might not be a concern. I hope it works out."
I am with everyone else and agree that these prototypes are concerning. After hearing it's only a rough version I feel a little better; but still nervous. One of the biggest draws for me was the aesthetic appeal of the original. Also the trailer for the 2 has them holding one that looks like the 1; so we were led to believe it will look similar. Please try to keep it close to the same. If it has to be bigger we understand; but I am not sure if curving it or adding this shell type thing is smart.,9 months ago,"Hi Frank; Thanks! Totally agree; aesthetics are our priority as well. I think I need to share more images of the prototypes as they are pretty much the same size as the mocks we had for the campaign launch (also a little bigger than the original). We did show the original Light Phone in the video trying to tell the arch of our story (saw the problem; made the original Light Phone; now we're making number two) so that may have been confusing and I really apologize about that.

I guess one more thought on the aesthetics; for the original Light Phone we put aesthetics above literally everything else; and we came to regret that in certain ways because the phone sacrificed actually usability. This is something we want to find a better balance with in number 2. The 4G antenna made the size increase; but will make it so much more reliable. The light up keypad was beautiful; but completely impractical in direct light and the tiny screen was hard to read for many users.

We want to make truly beautiful objects; but we also want them to work flawlessly as intended. I am confident we will deliver an awesome phone that I am seriously looking forward to using daily myself. The E-ink screen is inherently a little weird; the off white color the need to refresh; but I love that it is so different than the glossy screens of smartphones. We have a ton things we are planning to try to make this the most beautiful e-ink phone it can possibly be; and I can't wait to share

Joe; I do love the transparency you guys are providing; and the humility. I will stay on board and see what is to come. Hoping to see a sleek final product start to round out that wows me like the LP1. Just to clarify my biggest question...is that ""outer shell"" looking thing just for you guys to test things? And if so; are you still planning on a smooth seamless front? I love what you guys are doing and I hope it changes the future! We need to spend less time on our phones!

Thanks Frank. It was just a sizing test. It's not an ""outter shell""; the angle is weird but I was trying to show off the button placement and headphone jack. It's a piece of glass that is painted on the underside and the e-ink module is attached to it by hand so that we could see the size of the screen relative to the final form factor. The glass is attached by magnets so I could upload different UX tests. Not a reflection of the final product but an interesting piece of the process I thought."
Thanks so much for posting an August update! I've been eager for new info. FWIW; I actually really like the curved back. I know it looks goofy to people without much experience with one; but my old Moto X 2013 had a curved back and was the most comfortable phone I've ever owned. My Kindle has a curved back and I love it also. Feels nice and looks better in person than it does in pictures. A flat back will always look nicer in photos but is less comfortable.,9 months ago,"Any chance of getting pictures focused on black/white UX? The black phone looks cooler; almost like a mini-Kindle; but I feel like the reading experience on the white phone will be better. (I know the software offers the option to invert.) I'm leaning white for the reading experience but I'd love a few more pictures.Also; shout out to whoever designed the UI for texting. I LOVE the lack of speech bubbles. Reminds me of Hello SMS for Android.

Oh sorry; one last thing. You mentioned better support for directions in the hardware; which is fantastic. I'm glad that seems to be finalized as a definite feature coming. Any idea yet what that'll look like? Will it be a custom solution or a version of Google Maps (you're running a custom Android ROM right)? Right now I'm in NYC and take public transportation; will you support that or is that too complicated? Driving/walking only? Thanks!

Thanks for the feedback Thomas! I'll try to do a mini-update next week with more photos for everyone; I sort of rushed that photo I took in the last update and the angle isn't flattering to the prototype (but shows the button placement well; which was my intention). The black version is already looking pretty stunning; will share more photos of that for sure. Glad your digging the UX; we are happy with how it's shaping up too. I'll check out that app for potential reference; I'm not familiar...

As for directions; I don't yet know what the details will be; but ideally we'd love to support public transit info if possible (we're NYC based too!). We have a variety of options to explore and are eager to do so when we get there in our development. It is possible to utilize Google Maps as the brains behind our tool; but want to see what other options exist as well before committing. Cheers! P.S. - it could be cool to have a little get together at our place for all our local backers."
Appreciate the August update; but want to share that I'm incredibly disappointed by the new design and lack of USB type C. This isn't what I; and I'm sure many others; hoped for based on the original video.Please consider altering your production schedule to sort out the kinks. I can't speak for everybody but I don't mind getting my phone a few months later if it means I'm getting something closer to what was originally promised.,9 months ago,"Just started reading other comments and your replies and learned some things I didn't know when I wrote the above. I hope you take all this feedback into consideration when it comes to weighing the importance of quality design. I also want to stress that I'm among those very impressed with your team's transparency and willingness to communicate. Kudos to you guys; and I look forward to future updates.

Thanks for the feedback Kristopher. I was disappointed in the USB port swap as well; although and maybe you've read this in comments below; there appears to be zero technical disadvantages to the Micro USB port we are using other than the less attractive port shape. In building a product there are many decisions and tradeoffs that have to happen; we try to use the feedback from everyone to inform our decisions as much as possible and we do take these comments very seriously.

Note that it's not just an appearance issue. It's 2018 and I've abandoned all things micro-USB by now; including my phone; keyboards; mice; and wireless chargers. So sorry; but this just feels like a step backwards; and I'm personally not excited about having to hang onto a different type of charging cable for this one product that I'm intentionally only going to use intermittently.

That's a valid point; and I'm sorry for that inconvenience. I can totally see how that would be frustrating if you only used USB C ports. That's impressive that you've been able to abandon all micro-USB by now. I see the allure of having a streamlined cord lifestyle; it makes a lot of sense. If this charging cord is the deal breaker; I can certainly offer you a refund as I know we promised USBC on the campaign. Thanks for understanding."
Hello Light team; Thanks for your last update but I don't appreciate the new look of Light Phone (I don't like the new form factor; it seems a new phone; without any design solution). It's very different from the first look (like the video) and the prototype's expectations. I'm sorry but I need to know if is it possible to have a refund and how to do it. I look forward for your kind answer. Thanks in advance,9 months ago,I'm sorry for any confusion in the last update. The design has not changed and I shared a less than beautiful mock of where we were at in the process. Our goal has only ever been to exceed everyone's expectations. That being said; we don't want anyone to be upset and we're always willing to give anyone a refund of course; please email us at support@thelightphone.com and we can find a solution for doing so (Indiegogo doesn't support this through the platform itself). Thank you for understanding.
I guys! I actually don't mind the prototypes and I know how difficult is to combine technical solutions to customer expectation.Some minor questions:- can you confirm that it is not dual sim? - I guess the screen size is fixed and we will need to leave with those big bazels. I really suggest to make usage of them; especially the bottom one as it is done in some android phones. At least integrating a home or return button.,9 months ago,Cheers Davide. The phone does not support dual SIMs that is correct. Interesting point about adding some functionality around the screen itself; we did consider it but ultimately decided against it as there would have been other compromises required to make it work. Great idea though thanks for taking the time to share!
I like the new grey version very well; but keep the cool design of the Lightphone 1!,9 months ago,Thanks Franz! We're going to make this the most beautiful E-ink phone we can make it; but the original Light Phone did not have a screen so they are pretty vastly different phones in that respect and could never be exactly the same. Hope that makes sense and looking forward to April :)
Loved the update and how everything is turning out! You guys are doing a great job and I can't wait for April to come around!,9 months ago,Thanks Jacob; I cannot wait until April either; eager to be using a Light Phone II daily. Hope that all is well!
Hello Joe. Based on the general response from the community it is clear that producing a sleek and minimalist final product is imperative for the success of the product; and therefore your company. I believe that the way in which the current design implements the e-ink display reflects its historic use as a paper alternative. Our intention is not to own a phone with a screen that feels or even looks like paper.,9 months ago,"E-ink is the perfect display for your product due to its minimalist appearance; but I believe that its time for you to revolutionize its implementation. A great solution to eliminate the seam around the screen area (which is a source of water ingress and potential source of QC issues) and create a beautiful phone to satisfy present and future customers; would be to mount the e-ink panel behind a slate of monolithic glass that would constitute the entire face of the phone (like popular phones).

In the areas around the screen the underside of the glass could be painted to produce a sleek looking bezel from the surface. The touch sensitivity could be implemented into the glass face. Implementing touch sensitivity into the glass might be an economically feasible alternative because it reduces the need to manufacture a complex glass bezel.

Also remember that cracks form in glass at right angles! You would need a large radius in the corners of the screen opening to make the display strong enough for daily use (I recommend that you research de Havilland Comet). I live in the NYC area and would love to meet up and discuss the project or check things out. Heres to an amazing Light Phone 2!

(please see all 4 posts above)

The underside painting of the glass could even be faded on the interior edge to create a seamless transition from the color of the bezel to the color of the screen  :)

(Sidenote: a larger footprint could equate in a thinner and more appealing screen bezel; thinner phone; and (maybe) more space to nestle internal components.)

Hi Stephen; thank you for taking the time. Completely agree about making the final product sleek; not just as a founder of Light but as a future user of the Light Phone II myself. I think its safe to say I want the same thing everyone else does too :) We did like how unique the E-ink screen compared to every glossy perfect smartphone screen. It is easy to read in sunlight; which felt very aligned with our phone as well; and its something that always drives me mad with using screens outside...

Fortunately some of the techniques you mention are already in place and being explored as we speak. We had to come up with many clever tricks to get the original Light Phone to how it finally shipped; and there were certainly a few moments along the way of oh no; is this ever going to be possible? I look forward to sharing our progress in the coming weeks/months. I think it could be cool to do a little local NYC backers meet up too; will keep everyone posted cheers.

The fall solstice was this morning and thus the winter grey has already set itself upon New York. But as an experiment; I took my BOOX Max 2 e-ink tablet (which I absolutely love) covered with a half-inch thick sheet of glass from my medicine cabinet outside to test its readability under the bright sky.

It was very easy to read! I suspect that part of the reason cell phones are hard to read in daylight is that they have a backlight that needs to compete with the power of the sun. Even with the glass; the e-ink display was a pleasure to look at.

Im glad to hear that such techniques are under experimentation. The original light phone was beautiful. I bet it would be very reassuring to the contributors if you updated us on what these potential alternatives are. A meetup would definitely be cool! Especially to learn what it takes to produce such a product and work with overseas manufactures. Happy Sunday.

My two cents (in conclusion) is that an exposed e-ink display is inferior to a glass mounted e-ink display for this application."
Must say I dont like the curved back either. I appreciate there have to be changes along the way but I really dont like the way it looks. Would have much preferred a slightly longer phone with usb-c; as your original specification; than micro usb.,9 months ago,I'm sorry to hear that you're not a fan of the slight curving of the back; it does look/feel great in person and we really like it.  Aside from the shape of the port we couldn't really find any other reason to justify the costs (money and timeline shifts) to redesign the phone longer to support the USB C port unfortunately. I hope that this makes sense; we're really trying our best to deliver the best possible phone within our constraints. We can offer a refund of course if this is deal breaker.
"People in case y'all didn't see this. Joe said; ""To be clear; these are totally only rough studies of the form factor and in no way photographs of the final product (they are very cheap prototypes!). I should have been more explicit in stating that; sorry for any confusion; I hate that I disappointed anyone because it is really shaping up so nicely. The glass; paint and screen were only for us to hold and test the various UX screen images. Trust us; the final product will look and feel awesome.""",9 months ago,"Thanks for bringing this point back up to the top of the thread; cheers Mike. We are just now entering the phase where we can try to perfect the aesthetic design and feel; which for the original Light Phone we spent many months taking it from our first pretty ugly prototypes to the final product that we proudly shipped. I learned a lesson yesterday in being more clear with my language around the context of the updates.

Its all good. I think everyone is starting to come back to the same page."
I agree with Clive; I wouldn't have pre-ordered the phone if the promo looked like this new design.  The small; light and cool part of the phone isn't there anymore.  I understand you guys have a lot of competing interests to balance; but this current version isn't doing it for me.,9 months ago,Hi Matthew; Thanks for the comment. I want to just clarify that these are not intended to be representations of our final shipping product. The size of the Light Phone II has not drastically changed at all; I think I may have confused people by showing it next to an original 2G Light Phone without proper context. We are just entering the phase of development where we try to perfect these aesthetics; and I really think everyone will be excited to see things progress. Hope that makes sense!
can I just say its very impressive how transparent you guys are being with what is a monumental task and the comunication  is incredible. Keep up the good work!,9 months ago,Seriously appreciated; Jack. Thanks a ton!
Im not very happy with the new design. I have to be honest and say it looks amateurish compared to the initial design that wowed me in the first place. If this is what it looked like in the promo I would not have ordered it. Sorry to be this blunt but thats how I honestly feel. Im not bothered about the money; happy for you to have it but I dont want his phone anymore.,9 months ago,Hi Clive; really appreciate your bluntness; honestly. It's one of the best parts of having backers through these stages. I feel that perhaps there was some misunderstanding in how I conveyed the context of these relatively cheap prototypes. The design has not actually changed; it's not a new design; we're just very early in development and are now about to enter the phase of aesthetic tweaking. Our goal is to deliver a stunning phone; and we still feel confident that we're on that track.
I hope you return to the original design as presented in the campaign. Its unique; minimalistic and modern.The new design looks REALLY cheap and boring.,9 months ago,"Hi Michael; I'm sorry for any confusion and disappointment. This is not a ""new design""; it's simply a rough mock up for us to feel the size of things. I wish I was more clear in my wording of the update. The size has not really changed since we launched the campaign. I have a feeling you and I want the same thing; as I will also be a future user myself. I look forward to sharing our progress as we go through the design phase to tweak and perfect the screen; color and details of the phone itself."
Im very disappointed after this last update. I was so excited with the initial design; but this last update has completely ruined the look of the phone. If I had know it would look this way with such a short battery life; I would not have preordered the phone. I hope they fix it,9 months ago,"Hi Nathaniel; Sorry to disappoint you with update and I understand that these mocks don't reflect everyone's expectations of the Light Phone II; and I actually totally agree with your concerns there honestly. These cheap prototypes are a way for us to test the sizing and placement of things; the glass is held on by magnets so I can change the screen to test the size of fonts and icons; it is in no means our aesthetic goal for the device; a phase we have are just now entering in development.

We have finalized the PCB boards and the mechanical engineering (the stacking and layout of all the pieces underneath the casing). That was the big news in the update; which we unfortunately didn't make super clear. We were able to test our antennas/electronics; but have not yet begun to work on perfecting the aesthetic of the casing which is what we just kicked off last week. There will be a few months of tweaking to come (called DVT 1 & 2 on our timeline). Looking forward to sharing progress!"
thanks for the update!  the USB C to Micro is a bit disappointing; but understandable.,9 months ago,Cheers! I agree re:USB port; but at least there are no technical trade offs other than the shape of the port itself. I love the way USB C looks; but we just could not rationalize making the phone longer to accommodate the USB C port. Hope all is well; and looking forward to sharing our progress in the coming months.
Also; as the spec and battery increase im happy for that. 2hours calls may seem not enough for people i dont really call much i mostly text. overall hope to see more improvement and opportunity to see it close to original idea. Keep up the good work and look forward to next month update,9 months ago,Thanks; Lorenzo; appreciate it! Just for the record; it's very likely that the talk time will well exceed 2 hours. I wish I removed that number from the spec list as it was a requirement (it must last at least 2 hours talk time minimum) not an estimation; but that's not clear from our list.
Nice to see the update has arrived; after reading few comments. I have to agree 1. The screen look little off and bumpy should be flat but remind me of iphone front design of ip4/se which i liked. 2 curved back not my thing. I used android and motorola never liked it. I hoped it stay small factor size of credit card and solid square all round like the promo video. this is reason i backed this for the size/design form. hopefully we can get option to choose between two design and size if possible.,9 months ago,Thanks for the feedback. We will be working hard on the screen for sure! The curved back feels really nice I have to admit; as I was actually pretty initially skeptical too. The size I also want to be clear; has not really increased; I showed an original 2G Light Phone for comparison; which maybe wasn't a clear comparison at all. Even in the campaign; the phone was larger than the original to accommodate 4G network; and that's a limitation of physics really. Hope that makes sense!
What is the resolution and DPI of the display? Do you know how many LEDs there will be and what their placement might be? I wonder if you could use them as a notification light (optional to user). Depending on placement you could experiment with animating them in a subtle manor. I'd appreciate a photo of the prototype in a hand or next to a credit card for scale. A sandy mixture of all the colors combined would be cool. I appreciate your transparency and allowing us to observe the process.,9 months ago,Hey Bradley! The resolution is about 270 DPI (480 x 600 pixels on a screen that is 45.12mm x 56.4mm). Right now they are exploring putting the touch panel and light module on top of the E-ink screen with the glass; I'll know more about the light after this process; but that's an interesting idea for notifications that I've jotted down. A photo for scale makes a lot of sense; will definitely shoot some of those so everyone can see (wish I could just reply the photo here honestly). Cheers!
Joe; thank you for clarifying and clearing things up. Please disregard my private message expressing my disappointment with the design from the update,9 months ago,No problem at all Joe; and honestly it is inspiring to see how passionate everyone is about the design of the device. We are too!! I mean; I'm kicking myself a little for initially bumming people out by not being clear; that really didn't feel good. Ultimately there is nothing more that we want than to deliver a truly stunning phone that everyone is proud to use; we are future Light Phone II users as well ya know. Cheers and wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead :)
Joe and Kai; keep up the incredible work.  All great work is a process. I really like the curved back; and would only suggest that there were no flat edge. In my opinion; the curved back and flat edge clash. Perhaps you could make the curved back flush with the front of the phone; like a Kindle; or curve the edge itself; like an Iphone? I supported back in March. Great products are worth waiting for and I know that's what you all will deliver; Thank you and your hard work is greatly appreciated!,9 months ago,
I just wanted to say thank you to Joe for answering and clarifying some of these CONCEPT images and my disappointment with them. It seems I wasnt alone.  Once again he was kind enough to clarify the design was a mock-up in the most recent update. NOT A FINAL PRODUCT DESIGN! I know the team is working hard and I am excited to see whats next. Keep it up and thank you for listening!,9 months ago,
To be clear; these are totally only rough studies of the form factor and in no way photographs of the final product (they are very cheap prototypes!). I should have been more explicit in stating that; sorry for any confusion; I hate that I disappointed anyone because it is really shaping up so nicely. The glass; paint and screen were only for us to hold and test the various UX screen images. Trust us; the final product will look and feel awesome. Thanks all for understanding!,9 months ago,
I know it's hard for a small company to bring a high-quality device to market. I'm sure the entire light team and partners are working hard. And  I know they're not final; but man the designs in today's update looked like cheap toys. No usb c either; and 2 hours of talk time? This update is really disappointing. I believe in Light's mission and really hope you continue to work hard and deliver a great product; but selling people the ideal and then giving them a lot less hurts your reputation.,9 months ago,"Hi Nicolaos; Thanks for coming from an understanding place; and I just want to reiterate that I should have been more clear in the context of these; yes cheap; prototypes. The curved back & size and ability to load UX images to a real E-ink screen was the purpose of them. They were not supposed to reflect a final mock up; my bad! No USB C is disappointing; but other than port size there seems to be no other trade offs. Talk time is very TBD; those estimates shouldn't have been included; sorry.

Thanks for replying quickly Joe; I'm relieved to hear these are just cheap prototypes. I didn't say it before; but I actually don't mind the slightly larger size. The curved back; button placement; and subtle logo look good too.As for usb-c; I understand there aren't really any functionality trade offs; just a bummer not to have a reversible connector.

Also; will it be possible for users to turn off cellular data w/out severing the cell connection used for calling and texting? It's easy to do on most android phones; and it'd be an easy way to increase battery life.

No problem! Size wise; it's actually really close to what we had shown in the campaign. I showed it next to the original Light Phone on the update; not an early version of the Light Phone II; which I think confused people too. Learned my lesson in being clear with context yesterday! I'll take some scale photos of the Light Phone II because the phone is really quite a nice size in the palm. Will need to verify more about the cell data with our engineers; but one thing about battery life...

...I want to clarify. The 2 hrs listed was a minimum requirement we set; it wasn't intended as an accurate estimation of the actual talk time. Battery life estimations are really tricky at this stage. In the past; we made a pretty big mistake with over estimating our first generation Light Phone battery life based off math calculations of power consumption that in real life use did not prove accurate at all. I am under the impression the talk time will be more than 2 hours. Hope that makes sense"
I have to also say that Im less than thrilled with the mockup designs. If theres a way to make the screen level with the rest of the phone face; I think that would solve most of the aesthetic cludginess along with a color/reflectivity match. Also; I like the suggestion of warm-toned LEDs for the backlight; since the backlight doesnt need to overpower ambient light like an OLED/LCD screen; theres really no pressing need for a cooler color temperature.,9 months ago,"Hi David; Thanks for commenting. Aesthetically there is a lot that will improve; I wanted to show off where the buttons were finally located and their size as well as our curved back. These mocks are terrible reflections of what we hope to have the final product look like in terms of screen/color etc. I really regret not making that more clear; sorry about that! I'm also interested in warm-toned LEDs and will see what is possible at this stage. Right now it's E-ink standard cool tone light.

Thanks for the clarification and continued conversation. On the bright side; if the only serious criticism you guys have gotten so far is due to an error in communication; Id say this project is going extremely well compared to other crowdfunded ventures Ive backed. Its very refreshing to get real responses rather than corporatespeak/evasion."
I have to agree and voice my disappointment in the design revealed in the latest update. It looks cheap and toy-like compared to the original concept which was sleek and sophisticated. The seamless front surface is a must!!!!,9 months ago,"Hi Chad; I'm really; really sorry for any confusion; but these were not intended to be representational of the final product aesthetic and I'm kicking myself for not making that more clear. We wanted to hold the final form factors; with final button layout and size; as well as load images on a screen. The glass is incredibly cheap; the paint is not matched and the screen is not seamless; all of which our team will be spending the following months working to perfect with our partners.

Hi Joe thanks so much for the clarification!! Im SO happy to hear that and Im sure there will be a few collective sighs of relief!"
thanks guys for working so hard!   The design does look quite different now; is it possible that the screen and bevel might be matched far closer.. yota have done a similar thing https://the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/yotaphone7.jpgif the matching could be at this level it would look alot closer to the original design. also is that the whitest E-ink screen available? I for one would much perfer the phone be delayed if its possible to create a result closer to the original aim,9 months ago,"Thanks Jack. Color matching is what we are working on right now. Team is actually in factory testing different combination and will continue to optimize the ink; coat and reflection through out the next few prototyping builds. Getting it as close as we can is the goal. Eink module is composed with layers of grey scale; so it ranges from lightest grey to darkest grey. Thanks so much for the comments. kai

Hey Jack; Thanks again for sharing that image; we immediately began investigating it with our engineers to see if there was something we could learn. Thought you'd find it interesting that is appears that actually is just a non functioning ""ideal"" mock; and having seen a few in person; they were less than satisfying to say the least. We are confident we can get much closer than they did to that ""ideal"" mock; and that is our goal and current focus. Cheers!"
But is 2 hours enough for talking??? But the standby time is cool but dang man; only two hours. But I'm confused; so about that estimate of time is over; would the phone die?,9 months ago,"We will be doing testing every build in the next few months and share the actual talk time with you and all backers. 950 mAh battery should give us a good few hours over 4g/LTE but it will also depends on the location and signal strength. Thanks for the comment. kai

Thanks kai; I appreciate the clarification."
Man maybe cause I thought that because it's basically a dumbphone. But I was thinking that the phone would be able to let users talk for hours without the battery draining much at all. That's why I never said anything about the battery because I thought that without apps and things running in the background; communication duration wouldn't be a issue. yet I'm not saying you guys didn't work hard on it; I was just wrong. And with people talking about the design; OG  version look perfect.,9 months ago,
I agree that the latest designs don't look as slick as what was originally proposed. But with that said; I still think it looks okay. I mean; looking back the original designs seem unrealistic. I doubt even Apple or Samsung with huge R&D teams could pull that off - let alone a small team like Light.Definitely going for the black colour. 950 mAh seems like a very decent capacity for the battery. A bit of a shame about USB C not being included. But still very much looking forward to April 2019.,9 months ago,Thanks David. Just going to quickly reiterate it here again; but sorry for any confusion about the aesthetics of those prototypes. It was much more of a form factor test and a way to see actual UX screens on the form factor. They are really cheap prototypes and that's why they look such! I can't wait to show you all our progress over the next few months. For our initial Light Phone we spent months getting it to where we finally landed; and it was a night and day difference before and after.
I am echoing the comments thus far.  This is not s light phone 2.  It is a different design.  If this were a completely new product I could understand but the premise was built on adding functionality to an existing elegant design.  Please dont turn this into a bait and switch.  I dont want this if it looks like the mock-up presented and backers should be given an opt out.,9 months ago,"Brian; I want to quickly assure you that we are in no way a bait and switch; you can certainly always opt out. I just mentioned in a few comments above; but I made a big mistake by not being more much clear in the context of these prototypes which were not intended to show the final phone as it will ship but for us to test the size and location of buttons as well as load some images of the UX on the screen and get a feel for the sizing and make adjustments accordingly. Thanks for understanding.

Thanks Joe; and I do understand. You have to admit ""looks-like"" prototype; and ""final dimensions"" in the update most certainly conveyed  finality in the design that was presented! Like others; I believe in the mission.  I also believe that if faced with a choice of features vs form factor; many backers would strongly go with original concept form.  It is what brought me here in the first place.  The backing received  is because of the great job that you did with the original Light Phone.

A very bad choice of words indeed. ""looks like"" was in reference to the size and location of buttons. The glass is actually held on to these with magnets so I can change the E-ink image; it's in no way final. We made many iterations of the shape and so these are cheaply made for us to play with; not precious at all. Thanks for your understanding. For the original Light Phone we spent many months after this point perfecting the look and feel; which is the phase we are just entering.

I look forward to it.  I think that the strong reaction about the form factor speaks to how committed the backers are to a compact; clean; simple device.  Sorry that your evening is now spent triaging the comments site; but your attention to it does reflect well on the mission.  thanks"
This update reminded me that there's going to be a backlight for night reading. If you haven't already sourced the LEDs; I'd recommend considering amber or red tones to preserve low-light vision and to avoid the 'wake up' signal our eyes sometimes get with blue tones.Been thinking about opening up my kindle to change the LEDs in there...I'm not sure about the move from USB-C to micro; but it's probably not a dealbreaker.,9 months ago,Interesting point. Currently we are using the standard E-ink recomnended light which is a cool tone light. I'll see what our options are but they may be pretty limited. I have been a big love of f.lux app and appreciate red tones for night time too. Thanks for bringing this up! As for micro switch; I'm also a little disappointed; but from what I can tell there are no tradeoffs other than port size which may be annoying if you mostly use USB C.
Hey Guys; I hate to write this but I am really bummed to see the design you posted. Pretty far off from the prototype I was sold on - clean; modern; seamless design that I would have loved to have. Again I'm sorry to write a negative comment but wanted to give some feedback on what we are seeing.,9 months ago,Totally appreciate the comment; especially that it's critical. It's the best part of having backers to share these with. I apologize for not making the context of these prototypes more clear. These are not great images of what we hope the final design to look like; but were more for internally feeling the same/size/location of things on the device. We made many iterations; hence they were cheaply made. Seamless screen is our goal and that's next part of the design process; hope that makes sense!
I'm not really feeling the new form factor at all guys. I really enjoy the flush/bezel-less aesthetic of the original concepts. I don't like how the screen and mic are sunken into the plastic casing. It looks like a pre-installed Otterbox case. This is a serious step backwards than forwards. It was unclear whether this was a final mockup or just ideas as they are actively being developed? This is just my opinion.,9 months ago,"Opinion appreciated! To clarify; these were more of a size/form factor of buttons and audio jack placement test than a final mock up and I think my wording of saying ""looks like"" really threw everyone off. These were cheaply made ways for us to feel the buttons and load images on the screen to test if our UX was too small etc. We want the screen to be as seamless as possible. The speaker however can't be covered by glass or it won't work; much like on a smartphone. Sorry for the confusion!"
There is a new phone on the market:https://www.blloc.comIt looks interesting; I dont know how your light phone and this one compare each other.,9 months ago,"I have seen this briefly. They don't provide a ton of details so I'm not exactly sure how they compare. It looks like it has all of the social media/news/email distractions of a smartphone perhaps just with a b&w interface? Certainly doesn't seem like it would be a ""lighter"" phone than a smartphone in function or size. I do think; however; more options in types of phones for consumers is exactly what we stand for; so we do like seeing other phones come to market. Thanks for sharing!"
"Joe you said ""So maybe you'll have a chance to try the phone earlier than April if you are interested in being a beta tester..."" Man; I loved to be one of the beta tester.",9 months ago,"Love the enthusiasm! In all fairness; we will most likely do a lottery for the beta amongst those who are interested. As we get closer to that point; most likely early next year; we'll be sure to email everyone. Thanks for understanding!

That's absolutely fine with me."
Also; when will the next update be published? It's been a month now...,9 months ago,Update should be posted tomorrow or Thursday; it's almost ready just want to add some images and re-read it a few times. Today I'm working all day with the software team and won't have time to wrap it up. It will most likely always be a month in between updates; but I appreciate you keeping us accountable.
I know several epaper displays support partial refresh; meaning only the part of the display that's changing is refreshed. Do you know if your display supports that? If it does; it could help allot!,9 months ago,Yep ours is capable and it's something we plan on using in various instances for sure. Thanks for pointing that out!
We just ordered two of the Light Phone 2s.  My husband and I are super excited about this.  What did you decide on directions?  I'm hoping not to have to buy a navigation tool for my car; but will if needed.  FWIW; texting and directions are important to us.  I know we're not the intended audience; but our light phones will be our primary phones.  We will be doing away with our smart phones.,9 months ago,Hey Robin! Thanks for the support. We do really hope to support directions; it's been the most almost unanimously requested feature after the core essentials; we just aren't sure what exactly it will look/work like given our phone's constraints. Love that you plan to use the Light Phone II as your primary phone; me as well so I do understand the need for texting and sometimes directions too. Cheers!
I think the biggest challenge for me is going to be not having WhatsApp and it's not because I prefer it but simply because no one I know uses SMS anymore.,9 months ago,I can see how that would be a challenge for sure. It's an annoying and unfortunate side effect of privatization (like Whatsapp being the primary means) of messaging and communication. SMS is a universal standard in that regard. WhatsApp is something we'll look into see what our options are.
I think the biggest challenge for me is going to be not having WhatsApp and it's not because I prefer it but simply because no one I know uses SMS anymore.,9 months ago,
Glad to join as a contributor! Also appreciate the open channel of communication between your team and backers of the project... After browsing the comments section I have found that all of my questions have been previously answered :)Look forward to the next update; and the day I get to hold the light phone in my hand!,9 months ago,Thanks for the support David; glad to have you as a backer and also look forward to sharing our next update with everyone!
Hey Joe; will you guys be offering any sort of case or skin for this phone? It doesn't appear to be a standard size; and I'd hate to drop it or scratch it because it certainly isn't cheap.,9 months ago,We do hope to offer at least one case option before launch; if not a few options as there are not going to be standard cases for the phone itself. There may be a variety of small pouches that hold the phone well because it's dimensions (not thickness) is close to that of a credit card. Agreed that it is not cheap; nor is it indestructible on it's own; which warrants a case in our opinion.
Question: How do I protect it from scratches and blemishes? I'm guessing it's not a standard size.,9 months ago,This is true; it will not be a standard size; at least for a precise fitting case. There may be many well suited pouches or other card holders that work. We do hope to have at least one Light designed option for a case for launch.
I'm itching to get hold of mine; April seems a long way away. I'm around a computer for most of the day; so I just don't NEED the'smart phone' I bought. The text messaging is very useful; as it was back in the 90's. The only thing I'll miss is the camera - but I'm sure I can live without it... :),9 months ago,Same! I'm sure April will creep up quickly however. I'm eager to be using the Light Phone II. We will be doing a beta program with some of our backers; most likely through a lottery system due to limited availability as we did with our first generation Light Phone. So maybe you'll have a chance to try the phone earlier than April if you are interested in being a beta tester...
"And I wonder; do you know a way Hollier; to convince people who are truly addicted to their phones and just can't see why to have minimalist phone. Because I told my siblings this is gonna be great and they looked at crazy. And I downloaded the ""Digital Detox Challenge"" app to train my mind to be prepared for this phone. It is basically making your phone a dumbphone.",9 months ago,"I'm not sure there is a way to convince someone necessarily. I think what convinced me the most was actually trying it; going light often; and loving what it did to my mood; thoughts and general being. I think inevitably everyone will eventually feel the habitual overwhelmingness that comes from our hyper-connectivity and begin to crave some sort of escape... at least it seems inevitable... We hope to create an alternative for when people get there; they can find a long term healthy balance

True; you gotta try it out first."
Joe Hollier; I really and I'm sure everyone enjoy you replying to us. But I was wondering till this phone comes out; what phone do you currently use and if it's a smartphone; did you minimize as possible for it to be considered a dumbphone?,9 months ago,"Hey Mike; Thanks! I've certainly done my fair share of experimenting with different phones over the years; from Punkt to Nokia; but I pretty much always have used an iPhone (SE). I've tried my best to have it mimic the Light Phone II; altering which of the ""potential optional tools"" I have and seeing how it works out. We're actually working on sharing what we did to see if others would be interested in trying it as an experiment before getting the Light Phone II and sharing with us how it went

I see"
Hi Joe; have you guys thought about using OLED instead of E-ink to resolve the refresh and always on issues? OLED display has really high contrast and given the UI most of places it will be blank; maybe it's a better solution?,9 months ago,"We haven't fully considered it honestly. I do see your point; there is a fun little keyboard called the OP-1 by Teenage Engineering and it has a stunning OLED display that works for their minimal color scheme wonderfully. We've been pretty intrigued by E-Ink however for a long time before the campaign; and although there is a refresh that inevitably often happens; I guess we don't see it as an issue; but just a characteristic of a unique type of screen that we can appreciate...

Id need some technical verification on this; but I know E-Ink is an incredibly thin module; so that may be a real issue if we tried to use OLED. There are some power saving benefits to E-ink; but I think what excites me is how legible it is in bright daylight. Ive always found it super frustrating to operate smartphones outside. I conceptually love how different our screen is; and its very aligned with our intentional limitations of the device. Hope that makes sense!"
Hullo! Really looking forward to the project's completion; this is such a beautiful piece! Maybe someone already asked this - is there going to be setting for Cyrillic keyboard? Typing messages in Russian with Latin characters is tolerable; but slightly odd; last happened to me in the 90s when SMS in Latin letters were cheaper to send than in Cyrillic :D,9 months ago,Hi Eugenie; Thanks for the kind words! I'm also very much looking forward to sharing the phone with everyone soon. Currently we are conservatively only promising support for latin characters however we completely understand the importance of making the phone more globally accessible and do intend to do our best to continue to improve support for a variety of international keyboards; we just aren't sure when at this point in development. Thanks for understanding and sorry for the inconvenience!
Hi joe; i was wondering if anyone havent mentioned this yet. i remember seeing the specification in the campaign there wifi? How will that work? Since there is no apps or browser what purpose is it beside possibly wifi calling. also when the next update coming.,9 months ago,"Hi Lorenzo; Yep there is wifi in the phone itself. It's true there is no ""internet browser"" on the phone itself; but wifi may come in handy. Be it wireless software updates; syncing your account so you can manage your phone on the web too; or maybe future optional features like free international communication or setting up a hotspot. You won't be required to connect to a wifi network of course. We regretted not having the option in the original Light Phone for syncing purposes if nothing else."
Hey Joe; thanks for your time and all of your hard work.I'm not sure if this has been asked already; but will there be an option to add an external microSD card? I plan on using the Light Phone for music; and 8 GB definitely won't be enough storage ;) Is there a way that could be added?,9 months ago,Unfortunately on the phone itself this will not be possible. 8 gb is not enough storage to be my dedicated music player either so I totally see your point. Perhaps could be done with an external case with a micro SD slot and the case would connect to USB? The USB definitely supports it being possible; just not sure how it could be done in an unobtrusive way. I've been toying with standalone music players again (old ipods); kind of nice as a dedicated device although pocket space becomes an issue
Hi Joe; lot of people have already asked for this; but it would be great to have the ability to record voice memos and simple text notes (for inspiration on the move) as well as a simple MP3 player for music; podcasts; meditations; etc.  Maybe the act of having to put mp3 files directly onto the light phone will cause us to think a little more and only put what we need on it. For me; that outweighs the inconvenience. It would defeat the purpose of the phone to have too many apps. Keep it Light!,9 months ago,"Hey Richard; We'll have more specific surveys to ask for feedback like this; but what seems to make the most sense to us for a 'notes' tool is to allow typed/spoken messages to be quickly recorded and auto sent to one's email. It seems too small of a screen to effectively sort the notes on the phone itself; but rather as a way to remind your future self when at your computer next about the thought you had. Does that make sense for your needs in thinking of a 'notes' tool? Just curious for now...

An mp3 player is less complicated to make possible for the end user than a partnership with a streaming service anyhow. We aren't abandoning streaming; but at a high level it's much more complicated because of digital rights management within the music world as well as our need for the platforms to collaborate with us specifically. We haven't fully dived into all of our mp3/streaming options and will definitely be asking everyone lots of questions about that further along in development...

But I completely agree about the phone not wanting too many tools. Keeping light is 100% the goal; and we will not drift away from that! Thanks again for the support and hope all is well :)

Great! Thanks for taking the time to provide feedback. It is a new experience for me to feel like a product company is actually interested in hearing its customers suggestions.  Cant wait to get hands on the light phone and try it for real.  This is going to make a lot of people this twice about the anxiety and stress inducing  smartphones we have all just accepted we have to carry around.  Until now."
Hey There! I am realizing that this phone won't come with any messages apps except standard SMS. I get that the main point is to get light... but SMS are not free to send in most countries outside USA! (Yep; we live in a tough world).I suggest including a light version of Telegram. This would make sense as it has an open source API that allows it to be implemented in any kind of device. Also; it is the best messaging app ?Please consider it for a future upgrade. It will be very much welcomed.,9 months ago,Hi John; Initially that is true; SMS is all we can promise for launch at this point. We'd love to support (in a Light fashion of course) alternatives to SMS that would be free; especially for international communications. All of us at Light also use various platforms when communicating overseas so we totally get the desire there. So far our initial explorations made it seem like quite the undertaking; and we will certainly look into Telegram as a potential option too; thanks for sharing that.
Hello! :)There will be an easy way to import all contact from smartphone?,9 months ago,"Yep; that's our goal. There may be a lot of factors depending on which type of phone your using and how your contacts are currently stored; but we'd love to make that process as absolutely seamless as possible. When testing other feature phones ourselves; this was a huge pain point for us as there was no easy way to sync contacts automatically to phones like the Nokia 3310. Cheers and hope that all is well; Paolo :)

Thx for the answer :)"
Hello the Light Phone team!Joe can i just say what a great job you and the the team have done so far on this phone and all its promo; making things simple and clear to us; just like the phone will be!I have read a bunch of suggestions and updates but not seen this yet; sorry if it has already been mentioned; but one thing that i would like to see is a personal notes section; has this already been incorporated or is there any chance it will make it in?Thanks and keep up the amazing effort!,9 months ago,"Oh and also; i remember reading not long ago that there will be a lock/unlock button. Will there be an option to unlock just by button and no pass code? (i find touch screen typing frustrating) or maybe a two external button press to unlock to save the phone unlocking accidentally in my pocket? up/down button and power button pressed together to unlock maybe?Just a thought!

Hey Brad! Cheers and thanks for the support. Notes has been a pretty requested feature and we have a few ideas for how we may be able to make a suitable notes tool considering our incredibly small screen. At a high level one idea was to create a simple tool that allowed you to type/speak a simple message which gets auto sent to yourself via email. Storing/sorting notes on such a small device seems inefficient in our current studies. We'll be surveying backers about such details as we get to...

That point in our development to make sure it makes sense to everyone as well. As for passcode; that will be totally optional. Right now we only have plans for simple one press of power button to wake/unlock phone; but that's an interesting idea to have two buttons as an option for opening the phone; thanks for sharing will take note of this idea.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

Great; thank you for the reply Joe! Also; sorry for bringing up such a requested feature. All the best with the rest of the project; i am so excited to get my hands on my Light Phone 2

Not a problem at all; Brad. Thanks for the kind words. Also eager to share the Light Phone II with you sooner than later. Cheers."
Hello. I was considering the possibility of a wallet designed to carry the light phone and credit cards. It would have RFID blocking security for the cards without interfering with the antenna of the phone. This could be sold separately and be very minimalist itself. I'm a mechanical engineering student in the New York City area if you are looking for personnel id love to get involved with this project.,9 months ago,Hey Stephen; That sounds pretty cool. It'd be amazing to see our backers creating accessories that suite their needs and possibly sharing them with the rest of the community. We'll be sharing our final dimensions in our next update (in progress right now; trying to get it up asap!) and perhaps we could share the 3d files as well with our community. Right now most of the ME work is happening in Taiwan with our manufacturing partners; but we seriously appreciate the willingness to help!
Hi Light; Congrats from Tokyo for your great success of Light Phone ii campaign! Can Light Phone ii be used as a mobile hot spot /wi-fi tethering? Cheers!,9 months ago,Hello! It is our goal to have the ability to use the Light Phone as a hotspot for tethering. Our hardware will support this; we are just not 100% positive if the feature will available to download by the time we ship our first shipments to our backers or if it will come shortly thereafter as an update. Regardless; the function will be optional and added to one's Light Phone II manually as some users don't care for hotspot functionality. Hope that makes sense!
Joe; I'm pretty new with the details on sim card. The light phone 2 will use a micro one I believe. So we could have to get one but I was wondering how do we notify our carrier? Like I have T-Mobile and I'm curious how that works.,9 months ago,"Hi Mike; We will have an update specific to exactly this closer to shipping to try to help as much as we can. Circumstances will vary slightly for users depending on region/carriers of course. The Light Phone II uses a Nano SIM actually. Some people will opt to simply use their existing SIM from their smartphone. You can alternatively ask TMobile for a second SIM for the Light Phone. We will also offer a few plans via Light directly; more details coming in a future update. Hope that was helpful!

Very helpful. Thanks"
Hey guys.  I started a new job a few months back which requires that I use a smart phone for certain apps critical to work.  It is with heavy heart that I am asking for a refund.  If this is not possible; I understand.  What is the best way to contact you if yes?,10 months ago,"support@thelightphone.com - no problem; thanks again for supporting our project and hopefully we can share a Light Phone or a future Light product with you one day!

Thank you Joe!  I'll email you soon.  I wish you all the success in the world.  I am going to do what I can in the future to see if I can find a workaround.  If I can; I will buy a phone from you down the road for sure.  I LOVE this idea."
Hi Light;A year and a 9mo ago I got rid of my smartphone. It was one of the most freeing decisions I've made (albeit challenging at times); but I was terribly disappointed at the lack of quality alternatives. In the end; I ended up giving up phones altogether and simply moving my # to Google Voice. Light Phone 2 is the first basic phone I've seen since then that I'm actually willing to buy.,10 months ago,"I agree with the other's who warn about feature creep. Not only does it threaten you're ability to deliver on time (an all too common problem that ruins startup's good will with their communities); but it threatens to destroy what makes Light special.I realize going light means different things for different people. My two cents: if it requires internet access; it's not light. MP3 player; calculator; basic calendar; texting: light. Browser; social media; mapping: not so much.

Anyway keep up the great work. Shout out to Joe for doing a great job responding to comments.PS. Any chance I could get a copy of the survey?PPS. I looked as much as I could; but didn't see any info on how much storage the device would have for music; contacts; messages etc. Has that been decided?

Hey there! Thanks a ton for the support and reaching out; sorry I got behind on comments this weekend; it's my pleasure to answer them honestly. I can completely agree regarding other basic phones we've tried; it's our inspiration for making the Light Phone II. Feature creep is of course a real threat to a phone like ours. I think that there are some inherent limitations that were intentionally made that really help keep the phone aligned; like our incredibly small b&w E-ink screen...

It will just never be good for consuming feeds of images; videos; information and advertising ever. The other reassurance we have is that all additional features beyond core phone calls/messages and alarm clock are completely optional. The features we call 'tools' will need to be manually installed and we'll never force new features on anyone. I agree about no browser; social media completely; simple mapping however seems incredibly important to many backers right now...

Will forward the survey shortly via email provided with your contribution; no problem. You'll automatically receive our next survey as well now that you are a backer FYI. And for storage the phone has 8GB internal hard drive; sorry for not making that more clear. Hope this makes sense; really excited to have you as a backer and to share the Light Phone II with you this coming April :)"
Hi there; Joe.First of all; congratulations on the great success of Light Phone II's campaign. I'd like to comment on the election of the OS: finding out you're implementing an Android-based operating system on the phone is rather disappointing; albeit expected. I really wish you could get ahold of PostmarketOS's team (to name a promising project on the smartphone front) and come up with a truly durable; functional; and open system to match your philosophy.Either way; keep up the good work!,10 months ago,"Hi Ireneo;  thank you! We're seriously honored with the campaign's turn out.  I'm sorry to disappoint with the news that Android is the core of the OS; it has been our plan all along; sorry for the confusion there. Realistically it felt like the only option within our means to achieve our Light Phone II goals. Allowing us to develop our OS quickly and effectively as the small team that we are and to hit our April timeline. Thanks for understanding and seriously appreciate the support!!

It's understandable; of course. I'm eager to get my hands on it anyways. Thank you for replying!"
Will airplane mode or do not disturb make presence on the light phone 2?,10 months ago,"Hey! Airplane mode for sure. We want to have a lot of ""notification controls"" that allow user to customize their phone; much like the do not disturb function; and hopefully taking it even further! However; it won't be called ""do not disturb"" which I think is technically a trademarked Apple name for the feature. Cheers

Thanks for the reply"
Hey there! Do you have any details about the OS yet? Will it be Android based? Do you provide an API to build custom apps? I love the idea of the LP2; and i would love to port an app for paraglider pilots to the Phone since the device would be perfect match...,10 months ago,Hi Daniel; Hope all is well. The OS will be Android based (at it's core) but won't look/feel anything like a typical Android OS. We do plan to create an SDK for developers to make their own customized 'tools' (what we are calling the apps of the Light Phone II); but we don't yet have many exact details of that SDK as of yet. Thanks for understanding!
"I'm very excited about the launch of this phone. It fills an important gap in the ""dumb phone"" market. The MP01 and even the upcoming MP02 from Punkt are way too light for me; and the preorder Blloc phone is too heavy. I love the idea of custom tools (maps; music player; etc) that can be added by the user so that you can adjust your experience. Thanks for all your hard work and I'm really looking forward to future updates!",10 months ago,Thanks Christine! I completely agree that there is definitely a gap in the market that we felt as consumers. I look forward to using the Light Phone II as my only phone as soon as possible. Eager to share more updates too!
Hey; I am super excited for the light phone 2. I was wondering; how likely is it that the phone will have some type of navigation for if you get lost in your car or something like that? That would be super helpful and the final step for me going light.,10 months ago,Hi Lukas; Thanks for your support and enthusiasm! Directions have been the most user requested tool for us to develop in addition to the core OS (calls; messages; alarm); so it is very likely that we will have a directions tool quickly; if not by launch. We are not 100% the nuances of the tool; but have been exploring how that will function with what seems possible given our various constraints (small e-ink screen; relatively smaller battery than smartphones; etc.). Cheers!
I wanted to ask but not now but I was wondering with all the new features you guys are adding for the light phone 2; will you guys make a new campaign video?,10 months ago,"Also is it possible for audiobooks or podcast to exist be on the light phone 2

Hi Mike; We definitely are wanting to do a big update to the campaign itself to reflect the more final design of the phone and spec. Updating the video is a smart idea as well which we may do; or alternatively we may share new updated videos in addition instead of replacing the original one. It is likely that both audiobooks and podcasts will be possible on the Light Phone II; we are just not 100% sure it will be included in the initial launch options or come as an optional update.

I love the optional update; thanks"
Dear Joe;I'm not sure this has been addressed. Will Group SMS/MMS be supported?,10 months ago,"Hey! We've talked about it with backers some in comments and definitely done a lot of explorations on our own. Group message we definitely plan to support; there are a lot of UX challenges with the small screen; but technically pretty straight forward. MMS support is a little different. Unlike phones that don't support MMS we will be able to let the user know that something was sent; and maybe have options to forward to email; but we don't plan to support displaying images on the phone itself.

Good to know.I second the user who said a simple emoji set (see Windows Phone/10 Mobile); at least for receiving; would be useful. I'm not a big emoji fan myself; but it could be done beautifully and simplistically."
What are your thoughts on googles upcoming RCS messages (chat) that is supposed to replace SMS. Will there be a way to add this feature to future proof the light phone II?,10 months ago,Hey Josh; We are watching to see how it evolves. We have a lot of questions still; and cannot yet tell if it will be an open (like an SMS standard) or closed (like WhatsApp or iMessage) system. Technically however; our device is capable of adapting; so it is totally future proof in that sense; it becomes a question of whether or not we think it makes sense for our users of the Light Phone II which at this point we don't know enough. Cheers!
Hi;I backed the project as soon as I heard that a second generation lightphone was in the works; but I was just wondering if you had any plans for a post launch update system; just in case any problems arose. obviously; I hope that it isnt needed; and thankfully the minimalist nature of the phone means it wont need any big software overhauls; if any; but I was just wondering if there were any plans for fixes to be sent out if any problems did appear. Anyway; Im still super excited for it.,10 months ago,

Anyway; Im still super excited for it.,10 months ago,"Hey William; thanks for being a super early backer! We totally have plans for post-launch updates. One of the first things we built into our systems is the ability for OTA (over the air ) wireless updates. It will make our development/beta process much smoother but also allow us to continuously push updates easily; however small or large they might be. We also are building an ""account dashboard"" website for the Light Phone II so you can manage the phone wirelessly as well. We're excited!

In addition to our updates to the phone in the case of any bugs or simply just optimization; we plan to continue to develop optional 'tools' that users can choose to add/remove from their phone's 'toolbox' menu and we plan to have dedicated software people working on those ongoing well beyond launch. I'm sure other product's make this claim as well; but we do feel that launch of the Light Phone II will just be the beginning of it's potential.  Cheers"
Looking forward to the Light Phone 2 and putting the distracting smartphone in the drawer. Call; text and alarm would be perfect; GPS/directions would be a bonus. Thanks; great idea!,10 months ago,Also very much looking forward to using the Light Phone 2 as my daily driver! Thanks so much for the support and can't wait to share it with you.
A note on battery.I'm at an extreme--both in battery size & phone utility-- and while; understandably; the compact size of Light 2 may keep from achieving this; I offer the following to show what's possible when data is off (sans MMS); and an Android handset is used w/o apps or accounts (Phone+Messaging+Contacts).Nokia 2 (4100mAh)https://www.dropbox.com/s/fpgj96we6t2kc2w/Screenshot_20180829-203512.png?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/668mr45n8mn96r8/Screenshot_20180829-204503.png?dl=0,10 months ago,Whoa; that's impressive! After reviewing all the feedback we received from both the first Light Phone as well as the surveys and comments about Light Phone II; we put a bigger battery in the Light Phone II than original campaign spec and we'll be sharing the finalized spec in our next update (we're verifying/testing now). We won't have super accurate battery estimates until we can do some real world testing; but our engineers are calculating we may be in the realm of 10+ days on standby.
HiCan I get a refund please?,10 months ago,"We can help; shoot us an email to support@thelightphone.com; please. Thanks!

HiHave sent the email :)Thanks!

No problem; thanks again for the support; I hope we can share a Light Phone II with you in the future :)"
Hey! This just occurred to me. Will there be a cell service icon to show how much service there is in your area?,10 months ago,Yep! There is currently a dashboard screen that you can pull up from the home screen to check signal strength; battery life and other important details like airplane mode and maybe the date/day of the week. Hope that makes sense!
Im not sure if anyones asked about WiFi-calling yet. That might be somewhat of an international solution for some users.,10 months ago,Totally something we have been planning to explore as a way to make international communication possible. Will keep everyone posted; thanks for pointing it out; David.
Well my OPO finally died :( ;then I found this and backed it right away.After going through all the comments; I feel reasurred that this can be used as a hotspot. I drive for my job and need WAZE. I want to leave my phablet in the truck and have this little beauty in my pocket instead of 180g of brick.  One thing I might have missed is ability for an Ereader? If no facebook; it would be nice to kill time with a favorite read,10 months ago,"I also need a recommendation for the lightest phone with wifi hotspot to tide me over; anyone pls!

Hey Bradley; Thanks for joining our campaign! We do hope to have hotspot support; we just are not 100% positive it will be available with first shipment to our backers in April; although not impossible that it will be either. Our concern is making sure battery life is sufficient for hotspot; but we'll be explaining in our next update we actually went with a larger battery than we initially intended. E-reader seems difficult to me considering how small the screen is; but it's possible to do.

Unfortunately I do not know any suggestion for such a device in the meantime; but eager to share the Light Phone II with you soon!"
My most important feature request is battery capacity !I would like a standby time of one week; as we had with mobile phones 15 years ego ...,10 months ago,"Hi Michael; You are not alone in this desire! One of our biggest take aways from our first Light Phone was that people really wanted a phone will much longer battery life. I'm excited to share our next update with you which will cover how we actually went with an even larger battery than promised in the campaign for this reason. Best; Joe

Thank you !!I like my Light Phone very much; but the Light 2 will definitely be an exciting new product !"
Also... will it support 255 or 512 gb micro SD cards??Because that would be awesome for an audiophile like me that wants to carry as much music as possible (my digital music library is around 300gb fat),10 months ago,Unfortunately there is no expandable hard drive slots on the phone itself. I also have hundreds of gigs of music and have always struggled to find a good mobile solution. One potential idea is maybe a case that adds physical music player buttons (for skip and pause etc... I don't like that on a touch screen with smartphones) as well as expandable hard drives somehow. We don't currently have plans for this; but it could be a workaround for us?
Fantastic update!,10 months ago,Thanks; Justin; eager to share the Light Phone II with you!
100% agree with Zeki. Will there be disc encryption? Maybe I glanced over his in the details. And if I have; I apologize.,10 months ago,No problem; sorry for not making it more clear. Currently we don't have encryption as an option in our 1.0 launch software; but it's definitely something we think would be really awesome if we could pull it off over time. We did speak with the Signal App team and at a high level they did not think it was an easy task at all; well beyond our current resources if possible at all. That of course was specific to integrating their platform; there may be other options.
Hi everyone; I just wanted to say that the least feature that I want on my light phone 2 is whats app or any other messaging app except for SMS. For me this would go completely against the original idea of this phone. Here are the core features for me; personally: 1. Calls 2. SMS3. Calendar4. Alarm5. Stop Watch6. Calculator7. mp3 Player with aux and bluetooth (Please no spotify or anything)8. Flash LightThis would be my personal favourite Swiss Army Light Phone 2.,10 months ago,"HI Zeki; While I personally agree; I would not need Whatsapp or any other messaging but SMS; we do want to try to make that possible for those users that would really benefit from it; and in a very ""light"" fashion not the full fledged app by any means. It will always be optional just to be clear. And currently; we do not have a set plan for integrating something like Whatsapp; which would require a collaboration with their team in order to ever include it on the Light Phone II...

Thanks for sharing your list of features. Flashlight is the only thing that would not be possible to achieve (at least without external accessory like a potential case with a flashlight?) because of the fact that the phone does not have a light other than the front light that makes the screen visible in darkness. We don't think that light will be strong enough to be used like a flashlight effectively. Cheers!

Thanks for the quick reply; Joe! Its great that all the features are possible (even the flashlight with a case). That makes me extremely happy. Believe me; its so hard to find a simple feature phone with a decent mp3 player; so this would be my dream. Ive put my smart phone to rest last month and its actually a liberating process to go back to an old skool keypad Nokia phone. BUT; the mp3 players really arent fun to use. So; if it is possible to add this feature; Ill be happy."
The lightphone is offered black or white. I assume that the body of the phone is made of aluminum. So how about - in the sense of minimalist design - with a thirt variant: aluminium raw? Would look pretty to the black or white display.,10 months ago,
Ive seen allot of people asking for an LED to be built into the phone to be used as a flashlight. What if the case was a battery case that also happened to include a LED and a single button to turn it on/off? You could even go so far as to include wireless charging in the case. It would be an analogue tool case for a digital tool box.,10 months ago,"That's interesting; thanks Kenneth. A dedicated button for a flashlight would make it super handy for easy use.  Our USB port will support ""smart accessories"" like cases (don't love the way that sounds and this idea is fairly analog as you mention) so technically that shouldn't be the problem. We'd want to poll everyone and see the interest; although at scale such a case might be affordable; we'd need make sure enough people wanted them to justify the higher initial costs of production. Cheers!"
This might sound crazy; but how about adding a little LED flashlight?! Its a basic on phones and an incredibly useful tool!,10 months ago,As much as I personally agree and think that could be awesome and useful; I don't think it will be possible on Light Phone II; especially this far into development; to pull it off. Kai and I were split on this and ultimately left it off the table. The light from the screen may be enough for reading a menu in a dark restaurant; it won't be enough to see where to walk in the dark most likely. Kenneth's idea of a case is interesting! (see comment above)
"I was wondering on the details or development for the protecting case of ""The light phone 2""; Will that be available before the phone comes out or after due to fact that the phone could be fragile? I just want to be prepared for the phone safety in hands of us customer.",10 months ago,"Hi Mike; I think it makes sense to have cases available prior to shipping so it can be included in our first batch to our backers. We have not fully explored cases yet and are holding off until all of the antenna testing is completed and we can 100% lock the shape and design of the phone. Fortunately cases have a much shorter timeline for production so it's not as urgent.

Thanks I really want  to be secured because I'm pretty clumsy. Thanks for commenting man."
From the home screen I'd like to be able to scroll up for the phone (like the interaction for moving between the contact cards) and down for the dashboard. Clicking on the clock for non time functions seems a little odd to me. Enjoyed the update!,10 months ago,"That's a great suggestion; Bradley! Totally in line with our thinking too. The time linking to dashboard can seem a little weird; I guess we saw it as ""information detail"" by expanding time to signal; battery;date etc..; but I appreciate the feedback that it feels odd to you.  Perhaps both a click on the time or swipe from top could open the dashboard. Once we are able to play with the UX on actual phones that will be telling. Thanks again for sharing that suggestion; definitely noted!"
I've been wanting a phone like this for years! I've happily backed the project; though my only concern/question is if the phone screen is backlit. I've assumed it is; but can't find any information stating that is actually the case.,10 months ago,Hi Michael! Thanks for backing! Sorry for not making that more clear; we should maybe update the campaign to reflect the fact that yes the screen will light up when it is dark. It's technically a side-light I believe they call it for an E-ink screen; but there is a ambient light sensor that will know to light up the screen when the phone is in dark areas. We assumed that this was obvious because the alternative of no light seems very impractical; but we should have mentioned it more clearly!
This is a perfect example of minimalism; just backed.  I watched your videos including the July update video.  I like how you are making the contact the center of gravity and have all messages and calls related to that contact in a single view.Couple of thoughts on the optional features you're investigating:HD Voice / VoLTE - The goal of this phone is to talk with people; so consider making the voice experience #1Voice control - Being able to call and message using voice simplifies the UI,10 months ago,"Hello and thank you for your support and kind words! Eager to share the Light Phone II with you. I need to verify but I believe the Light Phone use the LTE network for most voice calls and falls back to 3G if the LTE is not reliable enough. By ""voice control for messages"" do you imagine it as voice-to text or actually sending little audio messages? Either might be possible; just curious what you had in mind! Thanks again for the support :)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wideband_audioMy understanding is that most US carriers have chosen to enable wide and audio/HD Voice only over Voice over LTE.  If youve had a FaceTime audio call and a regular phone call you know the difference; so much more of a persons tone and emotion come through clearly on a wideband audio call.I was thinking voice to text; Likely via an API https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/

Actually I think its service like this: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/

Going to investigate with our engineering team to understand a little bit better about Wideband audio vs Voice over LTE for Light Phone II. I do know the difference you are referring to and agree that for a phone encouraging voice calls as preferred method of communication it seems that audio quality should be highest priority.  We have some ideas for voice to text that we may be able to use from Android itself; I was trying to make sure that's what you had in mind vs audio messages. Thanks!"
I was wondering if are you guys are going to incorporate a music service for ex (Pandora; Spotify; tidal; etc)?,10 months ago,"Just to elaborate on the music a little bit as it is tricky. We do want to offer a few ways for users who want music/podcast to enjoy them. We understand many users use platforms like Spotify; and that may be preferred for those users; but others don't use Spotify so we'd be hesitant to force users into a platform. Ideally we'd have a few options. Integrating those platforms would also require cooperation with those companies; which so far there seems to be some interest. We'll keep you posted!

Thanks. I understand that you guys aren't trying to put to much or too little. Sorry for the overwhelming task; still thanks for commenting.

My pleasure honestly; love the enthusiasm of our backers; it's inspiring!"
"Hello Joe Hollier; the light phone team; and everyone. I just contributed and I'm really excited for this phone. I really think this phone is gonna change the world how people are going to see phone and minimalistic phone. I love the modern look but simple features. It's the embodiment of Steve jobs's views on genuine simplicity. I was thinking this phone isn't a ""secondary phone"". I think you guys elevated this phone to be considered primary. And please have GPS and music store or similar.",10 months ago,Hi Mike! Hope all is well and thanks for the support! I do plan to personally use the Light Phone II as my primary device. There will be gps in the phone however we have not flushed out a directions tool and/or music tool at the moment. These were two of the most requested tools and will definitely be exploring them. We are simply not sure yet what will be available by our first shipments to our backers and what may become available as an update. We will know more later this year. Cheers!
Saw the update. Well done with the progress and really excited to see things coming to life. So how are you guys dealing with the messaging services? Simply Text messages or any BBM; Whatsapp or Telegram clients? If we can have a bit more information on that it would be very useful. Awesome job guys. Keep it up!,10 months ago,Hey! Currently we are focused on the core operating system using standard text messages. We've at a high level tried to start some conversations with teams at other messaging clients to see how difficult an integration would be; but we have not been able to get accurate estimations yet other than that it seemed quite difficult. We are not abandoning them as ideas at all; we just can't promise other messaging at this stage without a plan of how to integrate smoothly; I hope that makes sense!
The e-ink issue with a black screen compared to a white screen is concerning but will Backers have an option to chose a b&w phone? Black housing and white screen? It would be easier for users to know which is the viewable side at a glance this way and I think it will look cool.,10 months ago,HI John! It may be possible to allow the user to easily switch the mode (white on black or vice versa for either model). The screens are identical parts for either model; capable of displaying either way; we'd just have to add the ability to inver the colors it to our settings I think. I will admit; I wouldn't quite call it an issue yet; I do find charm in the ghosting personally. We'll keep everyone posted with our progress with the various color ways.
I'm curious about images on the e-ink screen. It looks like there will be none. My concern is FOMO. Other people often text images; videos; and emojiis. Sometimes these images are important; like for work or school. Is there any way to send the image/video to our email? And then for the text to state: An image has been sent to email@gmail.com. This suggestion makes sense to me. And; no more emojiis? Darn. It might make it harder to understand the context of a text.,10 months ago,Hi Christopher; Currently there is no intention to include images; but we have a few ideas for workarounds which forwarding to email was one idea. At a minimum I think we'd want to let the Light Phone user know that image/video was sent; perhaps automatically also let the sender know; but until we get to that exact detail in development; we don't know exactly what will be possible. Thanks for sharing the suggestion; glad to hear that's maybe what users want.
So happy for the update; nice to see it on schedule and improving. Look forward to more update and prototype photos. just one question in the video i saw 3 button but the promo video shows 2. i thought the screen can be touched and scrolled except the menu using button? was this changed why the third middle one. Having 3 seem weird. I always been used to having 2 button on smartphone side.,10 months ago,"Hi Lorenzo; Sorry for not making that more clear; I think we briefly touched upon in an earlier update; but we did add a third button. In our mind it's a dedicated ""toolbox"" button and so whatever screen you are on if you need to move to another aspect of the phone there was a dedicated button. Up and Down keys work similarly to the ones on your smartphone; controlling volume of ringtone or speaker if on a call. I hope this makes sense!"
Hi JoeNice video with the UX overview. I did notice hat you have to be on the phone screen to see if you had any missed phone calls or unread messages. I was thinking that perhaps there could be a subtle visual cue on the unlocked screen for notifications. Perhaps the circle for the phone app could be unfilled if there is no new notifications and filled/coloured in when there is one (or more) new notification(s). Thanks for the update - looks very good.,10 months ago,"Hi David; Very good point. We did not include ""notifications"" in that little sketch. We totally agree that there should be an easier way to see missed notifications; and subtle visual cue is a great idea. We also think some people may want their new text/missed call notifications to appear before the home screen like on a smartphone. We haven't fully flushed out ""notifications"" and ideally will have a few options for users as the thoughtful consideration of notifications is key in our phone."
Hey! Just read the July update and Im so excited for the Light Phone 2! Though its totally understandable; Im pretty bummed that the ride sharing & diretions apps got cut from the first version. It sounds like there might be options to add them in the future. Do you have any more details on that? Thanks!!Hazel.,10 months ago,"Hey! Sorry for any misunderstanding Hazel! The ""Core Functionality"" sketch is the base of the phone; and all the tools we do plan to introduce will be easy to optionally add/remove (including ride share or directions; two of the most requested by backers) . The minimum features; that actually many users don't want more than; is the calls; messages; alarm and that's how it will ship. The other tools may even be available by launch; but we want to make sure it's optional for our 'lightest' users."

Hello; I recently read the July update. How much difference is there on the white and black versions of the phone in terms of ghosting? Could this be corrected on the black model with a different refresh rate?,10 months ago,We'll be doing much more thorough tests and examples in time (and everyone will have the chance to change color if they want of course). After one refresh the white almost always clears ghosting; where as the black may require two; is so far what we can tell. The ghosting was a little exaggerated in that example and we do think there may be ways to offset with more refreshes or playing with the rate. TBH the ghosting does have a charm to me; it definitely doesn't feel like a smartphone.
Hi Joe; sorry if this is a question your team has already answered. I'm not seeing it anywhere. I realized; after I backed the campaign; that the Light Phone 2 is useless to me without the capability to type in multiple languages. I use Japanese and English; and would need the ability to switch between both. I'd imagine many users globally are similarly multilingual. Will multi-language support be included? Please say yes!!,10 months ago,Hi Mari; I'm really sorry for not making this more clear. Currently we can only promise English language support. We do intend to support other languages; but at this stage we are not sure how difficult or not that will be and are afraid to promise it. I know that's not the answer I wish I had for you; but it is honest. Thanks for understanding!
Just wondering if you had considered copy-paste functionality for messages. This could really come in handy if you need to send multiple people the same or a similar message without making it a group text.,10 months ago,Good point; David. It's not currently in our requirements document; but is something I have made a note of and I can definitely see how it might be useful.  Thanks for bringing it up!
The movement is real . . . http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180814-the-new-phones-that-are-stuck-in-the-past,10 months ago,Thanks for sharing!
Simple Case that could be function as a clock accessories on table will  reasonable stretch goal: other things I would give suggestion if you can find out about primo apps. That apps can be used for virtual number and by that apps we can call internationally for free. I don't know if you can consider that for feature development.,10 months ago,"A way to call international for free I think everyone agrees is awesome and welcome. Technically it should be totally possible on the Light Phone II; we just don't yet know how it will work and can't promise it by launch without further exploration; but we plan to continue development ongoing beyond launch. I'd love to have a way to call internationally for free too.

I thought a bedside dock that when the phone plugged into automatically displays the alarm clock tool on the phone would be something I would use. Also even without a case it may be possible for us to have an option to have the time always displayed with very minimal battery usage because of the e-ink screen."
As cases seem to be a thing:I'm totally in and would love to see something in the future. Id prefer something thats more like a leather wallet (without any branding) with a slide-in compartment for the light phone a few card slots and perhaps a zipper or something for smaller things like change; sd-cards and stuff.Something super-sleek; minimal and stylish.I'm not a fan of any of these plasticy clip-on cases for phones. Dbrand (https://dbrand.com) skins would be cool; though :),10 months ago,Cool stuff; we should definitely include some case ideas in a future survey. I think it makes sense to have at least one case available; but ideally a few options. Cheers!
If there's a current survey; I would love to get one! Thanks!,10 months ago,So far we've only sent the one survey from late April; did you get that one? I can resend it too. We're in the process of testing our proposed designs for things like SAR levels for required certifications to it's antenna efficiency. Once those are successfully completed we'll have a lot to share.  We plan to do our second survey after the upcoming hardware update (most likely early Sep.) where we will want specific feedback on the final phone spec/designs. Thanks and hope all is well!
Hi; just backed and VERY excited for this. Just a couple things: can I be added to the survey list/email updates? And how durable is the screen and device in general? What I miss about old phones is how you'd just throw them in your pocket; in a bag; on a table; wherever and not have to worry about scratching them or shattering them like with modern smartphones. Thanks!,10 months ago,"Also; what happens when someone sends you a multimedia message like a picture or a voice message? Will the light phone be able to handle that? I can tell friends to send me media via Facebook or something so its not a huge issue but Im just curious what will happen on light

Sorry for the lack of automation in getting the older survey; but every one is actually automatically added when they pledge to receive all future updates/surveys fyi. Durability will most likely not be able to compete with those old phones unfortunately. I believe it's the glass for touch screen that makes it really hard to achieve with our design (and smartphones in general). As much as I'd love it to buy indestructible too; especially knowing myself lol; just wanted to answer realistically.

Multimedia message display is something we haven't finalized completely. One thought is to let the sender and Light Phone user know that something was sent that was unable to be received via text ( a customizable user auto-message of sorts). A future idea might be to have the option to email it to yourself; or maybe even automatically email them. When we get to the point in development to understand what is possible we will send surveys to see what our backers think makes sense."
Also; a question about the charging cable that comes with the phone. Will there be an option for it to work a car cigarette lighter? I drive an old car and USB is not always an option.,10 months ago,"Current plans are to include a USB cable; and although customized aesthetically it would be a pretty standard USB charger. I don't think it will be possible to offer other options for cables with the phone unfortunately; but perhaps there are third party adapters that will work well for this?

If it's a standard USB; there will be adapters available."
I want to second the desire for a case. Something as simple as this would be wonderful! https://www.amazon.com/Airror-iPhone-Flexible-Non-Slip-Protect/dp/B07G52X231/ref=sr_1_8?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1534357001&sr=1-8&keywords=iPhone+5s+case,10 months ago,Thanks for sharing the example too; noted.
Hi Joe; will the displays have a mean-time-between-failure difference? This may impact may decision on phone color. I want to keep the phone for as long as possible. You mentioned that the display will work best as purely black and white; but photo 5 (Black LP2 with Mom; xxx-xxx-xxxx; call/message) Mom and the number appear in grayscale. Any update on whether users can choose to go between black/white or grayscale; or will phones be locked into one or the other? Keep up the great work!,10 months ago,"By ""mean-time-between-failure"" are you referring to the refresh state for e-ink screens? If so; the black screen suffers a little bit more ghosting and might require more refreshes in some instances than the white version.  (1/2)

The screen supports grayscale and in our initial interface explorations (like the image you reference; which is not an actual e-ink screen fyi; but digital mock up) we used grayscale to help with hierarchies of information. We still plan to use some grayscale in this way; but as we are testing on screens and working closely with the E-Ink engineers we've learned how the screen is optimized for black and white for optimal contrast (especially with small typography).  I hope that makes sense!"
Random question. Can I just take the SIM card out of my iPhone and use it in my light phone. And just keep swapping back and forth?,10 months ago,In theory; yeah; you totally could just swap the SIM; meaning no extra costs and automatically keeping the same phone number. The only major carrier not well supported in the US is Sprint; so that would be the only caveat.
"I love how in the last update more updates were promised ""soon"" but it's been more than a month since then...",10 months ago,Hi Kenneth; You are very right and I apologize for the delay on updates; it's my fault. There are a few new ones we've been working on simultaneously (one for UX; one for hardware design and tech specs; and one for coverage/antenna) and I've been behind on flushing them out to share with everyone as we focus all our energy on keeping everything moving full speed. Expect the UX update by end of the week; if not earlier. Thanks for understanding and keeping us in check! Cheers
Hello;Could you please add me to the survey list as well ? Looking forward to get updates.,10 months ago,No problem; you should see an email from me shortly :)
I'm sure it will not be too hard to use a different material; all that is necessary is to find Titanium that is the same thickness as the Aluminum used; and no design changes are necessary. Personally; I'm prepared to pay more for Titanium.,10 months ago,"If mass-production of a Titanium option is not feasible; or if there is lack of demand; a one-off or batch-produced model would be a great option!

I wish this would be possible; I really do; but unfortunately I do not think in any short term we will be able to offer such a premium as titanium. Perhaps it will be something we may be able to offer in the future; but currently it does not seem possible. Will definitely keep it mind; as I would also be the type of user willing to pay a premium for better materials. It would require however a complete new tooling as well as testing; which is well beyond our current budget.

Thanks for understanding!"
"Hi again;I think I mentioned dust-proofing the buttons and speaker-area as important...  in addition to that; I'm sure some of our backers are looking for premium materials to be used; like a Titanium option. It will help keep the phone up to date; and hold an edge to competitors. There is a ""Minima"" phone coming out in the next couple years designed by a Frenchman.  Titanium will assure Light 2 has better drop resistance and luxurious handling(see Rubin's Essential phone).",10 months ago,
Im super stoked on this project! Your team is doing business in a way that I think the world could use a whole lot more of. Something crossed my mind today (when I checked back on this campaign for the millionth time): how are you guys handling the sound design of this thing?Ringers and clicks and that sort of thing. Especially with the inclusion of an alarm this round; Im curious to hear your thoughts/stance on it (or maybe Ive missed/overlooked it :/ ),10 months ago,Hey Daniel; Thanks for checking in again and bringing this up. It's a key aspect of the experience in our opinion and we've been collaborating with a very talented musician/friend for all of the sounds (he also made the song for our campaign video). We've been having some deep discussions about the philosophy of the sounds in the phone experience and plan to share an update specific to just our sound explorations in due time. Brian Enos work for Windows is really inspiring :)
How many surveys have you had so far? I was part of the introductory survey; was there another one you sent out? If yes; I might have missed that email and would appreciate it if you can forward. If not; when is the second survey planned? Thanks!,10 months ago,"Hey! You have not missed a survey; we only sent one thus far. That survey helped us make sure that we tried our best to build hardware that would support all our potential future use cases. After our big summer updates for hardware/software; we will send a second survey for feedback. Come later in fall/winter we will be able to send surveys with more pointed; specific feedback relating to experience; but a lot of developing now is the ""under the hood"" systems. Hope that makes sense!"
Hey development team!I was wondering if I could get added to the survey. Looking forward to the phone.,10 months ago,Just forwarded :)
Would you consider offering a case for the light phone?,10 months ago,"We'd love to offer a case and hope that we can have at least one option available by launch; but in focusing on the phone itself we have not yet explored what potential cases we can introduce. What type of case did you have in mind? Thanks!

Just a basic case that would protect the phone from harm would be great :) It would also be interesting to explore the idea of a wallet case for the light phone.... Just throwing ideas out there :) Thank you!"
Looking forward to some focus One request is security will it have a lock and no backdoor?No tracking EtcAwesome looking device,11 months ago,"Hi Andy; Regarding the security question; there will be a passcode lock; but I'm not sure what ""no backdoor"" means exactly; if you could clarify I'll be able to get you a more solid answer; thanks!"
Could I also email me the survey? Thanks!,11 months ago,"*could you

Not a problem; just sent!"
Lite; Is there any way for this phone to use something like WhatsApp for international use? I'm wondering what kind of international travel options might be usable.,11 months ago,"We totally understand the need for a way to connect over data while traveling/chatting internationally. Currently; WhatsApp is not on our timeline to include in the phone. We've had preliminary conversations with some messaging apps like Signal; and so far it seems like it's a little bit more complicated than we'd hoped. It's not that we have given up; I just want to be realistic that it may not be available by the time the phone ships. Thanks for understanding!

No problem! I am not a ""frequent flyer"" to Russia or anything. But I'm hoping to go back so I wanted to inquire. I appreciate the update!"
Gentlemen; I am SO excited to go light next year!  I've had my smartphone on grayscale and have less than one page of apps; but still find myself burning time.  I can't wait to put it to bed.One question/request: is there any possibility that a notepad will be added to the phone?  That's the one thing I'm going to miss.  If not; I'm going to be texting myself things.Still stoked nonetheless!  Thank you.,11 months ago,I also cannot wait to use the Light Phone II and put my other phone to bed! Notepad is something we've heard an interest from other users as well and we will explore when the time comes. My concern is that the screen is too small for it to work well. There is not a ton of room to input text when using the keyboard; so while we are open to exploring it; we'd likely only make it available to everyone if we found a way to execute it effectively. Thanks for understanding! Hope all is well
Can I get added to the survey? I placed my order a few months ago and am really excited for spring '19!,11 months ago,Just emailed the survey! Thanks
Hu Joe; is there any stretch goal for 2.000.000 USD? #Just curios.,11 months ago,There currently is not; but we might be open to ideas if you have any? Hope all is well!
Will emoji received in SMS messages display on LP2; or will they appear as small placeholder boxes?Also can the screen show greyscale or just black and white? The concept images look like they have greyscale; but I just thought I'd make sure.,11 months ago,Hi Brent; We haven't gotten far enough into the messenger development to understand what our options are yet for emojis; but most likely they will not show up on LP2; but I want to wait until we know more to fully say for sure how they will be handled. The E-ink screen supports 16 steps of grayscale however we've been working closely with the engineers at E-ink and they tell us that it is optimized for black and white rather than grayscale. Thanks!
Hi; really excited to be getting my light phone 2. I do have one worry; though. Will there be any likely limitations in terms of the cellphone providers I'll be able to use it with? I live in Colombia and I'm currently with Virgin. It is the only company so far that I haven't ended up hating and I would prefer not to have to go back to the other ones. Another question: Will I still be able to use my phone if I move to another country? Like; let's say; Latvia or Romania? Thanks in advance.,11 months ago,Hi Christian; We've been working hard to optimize the phone for as much international reach as possible; especially after learning from our survey how important that was to our backers. We'll have an update coming specific to just coverage and compatibility which should shed light on your questions above. Thanks for understanding!
Regarding lists; how would the input be any different than adding/viewing/deleting a contact? Perhaps; there could be expandable tools when the LP2 is connected to a computer?,11 months ago,Hello! As we've been plugging in our mock up UX designs onto the Eink screens themselves; we're really learning to keep each screen as minimal as possible so I feared that having too many options may get cluttered. When using the keyboard for input; you flip the phone horizontal; and it'd maybe just be a slightly slower process than if done via the web (computer as you mention). We do imagine that the computer would make it easier for tools that require more set up; i.e. if we do have Uber etc..
One thing that would be tremendously cool would be a simple checklist. Like a shopping list. Do you see this as a little feature that could be implemented?,11 months ago,"Hey there! I actually think something like this seems like this would make sense as a tool (optional of course).  I'm a big user of lists like this myself; however I tend to use post it notes most often. It would be interesting to explore if the Light Phone II could offer a more optimal experience than the old school paper lists and if so I think it's reasonable. What I'm unsure about is what the best way to input the list will be? Considering LPII screen is so small itself... Cheers!

Right now im using Apples Reminders as Shopping lists. Just one or two words per Item and a checkbox.To see how all this works in the LPII; is there any way we as community could contribute with design mockups?

Thanks for clarifying. One or two words should work. For input I meant did you imagine that one would create the list on the phone itself or through their computer? Right now all of our development work has been ""under the hood"" so to speak. I'm working on an update the walks through our current ""core functionality"" UX; the minimum guarantee of functionality that the phone will ship with; although we do hope we can offer a tool or few by the time we first ship as well. (1/2)

One thing that we're definitely learning is to keep each screen as absolutely minimal as possible. The screen is quite small. So the to-do list would have to be incredibly minimal in terms of how one would add/edit vs just using/checking off tasks. I'd love to be sharing more detailed images of our UX for group feedback as we go through the phases of the process and of course it'd be great if people have suggestions for designs to share; that's awesome too.  Looking forward to the UX update!

All that sounds absolutely logical.I think a simple Text list with a simple ~2020 square before the list items would be 100% sufficient. And Yes the list shoud be super minimal  just a textlist with a check mark and a function to add an entry and thats it. (removing an checking an entry would be the same imho.)In my case:Im just occasionally using the desktop version of reminders to add anything to a list. 98% of the time Im typing my these simple entries on my iPhone.

(sorry for all the typos and bad spelling)

Helpful feedback; thank you!

Thank you!Very much looking forward to LP2!"
Hi; I'd like to see the ability to support 2FA with something like Google Authenticator or Authy.  I think they just require secure storage of a key (no NFC or other hardware required); and generate one-time codes for two-factor authentication.  Bonus would be something like Toofer that just sends a push notification to your phone and you tap yes or no.,11 months ago,"Hi Jim; Would you be able to elaborate for someone (me) who is unfamiliar with 2FA just exactly how you imagine using such functionality? Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts with us!

You might be familiar with the two-factor authentication (2FA) process that uses texting; say from a bank website or maybe gmail.  When you log in; they verify it's you by sending you a text with a code that you then type into the site on your computer.I'm a software engineer; so I log into a LOT of stuff.  Many apps/web pages for work need stronger security 2FA than text messages; because cell phones can be compromised. (cont)

(sim hijacking: https://clark.com/scams-rip-offs/sim-hijacking-how-to-add-pin-mobile-phone/).  So for sites such as Lastpass (Enterprise/Pro edition); they require a 2FA app instead.  Take a look at https://authy.com/guides/gmail/ under ""Capture QR Code""  and here's my take on that process.  I log into a site with my username and password; and then it asks for a code.  That code comes from an app and I'm using Authy right now.  (cont)

To set up Authy; I first go to the site needing 2FA and get shown a code (QR Code; but there's always the option to enter it yourself).  I type that code into Authy; and then it starts generating 6-digit numbers every 30 seconds using a secure algorithm.  Then when I next log into the site needing 2FA; I pull up the Authy app; pick the site; and copy the 6-digit code to log in.  With a phone app like Google Authenticator or Authy; it's easy to setup; and then very easy to use to log into stuff.

I'm in the ""I want a light phone and no smartphone; using the lightphone as a wifi hotspot sometimes with my laptop"" group.  I currently have a feature phone and use it for phone and texting only (since it doesn't support apps); and the one thing I feel like is really missing for me is a 2FA app.I think this kind of app only requires securely storing the security codes for the sites; and making sure the phone's time is pretty accurate; so it seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement;

but I know how that really goes.Next level is an app like Toofer; which rather than generating random numbers every 30 seconds; sends you a push notification when you go to log into a site configured with it.  It pops up a prompt on your phone to see if you're the one trying to log in; and let's the site know if you authorize the login.

Sorry for the wall of text; but you said ""elaborate"" and maybe you didn't know you were talking to a geek.  ;)

and it's ""toopher"" not ""toofer"" for the 2FA push app; but apparently they got acquired; so... maybe Duo Mobile (https://guide.duo.com/android) is a better example

Thanks for the thorough explanation Jim; I definitely asked for it ;)  I do now see how that could be useful. While it's not on our immediate horizon; perhaps it will be something we can offer eventually. Cheers!"
Trying this again. I'm a bit behind but looking forward to the phone.,11 months ago,"Hey Byron; Is there something you need help with or was a question you left unanswered? Hope all is well!

Sorry for the late reply. I'm good and looking forward to the updates!"
Hi guys; really looking forward to getting this!Did I miss an E-mail about BackerKit? I can't find one in my E-mails.,11 months ago,"Hi Timothy; You did not miss an email; sorry for the confusion; we have not yet sent out the Backer Kit sign up. We expect to be sending that out with one of the upcoming updates; cheers.

Hey Joe! Thanks; just wanted to check. I'll keep an eye out."
Hey team;For some reason I didn't get the survey. Is there a way I can get that? Or is it too late?,11 months ago,Just forwarded the survey :) Unfortunately they needed to be shared manually to any new backers that have joined the campaign after the survey was sent in late April; thanks for understanding; and you'll be on the list to get all future surveys going forward.
It would be great if you could post the finalized set of features of the light phone 2 whenever they are locked-in. Also is there a way a plan to add software features/updates after the phone has been shipped?,11 months ago,"By additional I mean features that you guys plan to add but haven't completed by the time the phone ships.

Hey! There is already a plan and system for seamless updates and future tools can in theory continued to be worked on and added forever. For that reason; there may not be a ""finalized set of features"" list but rather a ""these are the features we were able to pull off by the time the phone ships to backers"" and a ""these are next features we are prioritizing"" lists. Reminder: All of the tools will be optional to add/remove to own's desires. Hope that makes sense!

Makes perfect sense. Thanks."
Do you think the backlight will be bright enough to function as a makeshift flashlight? That's one feature on my phone that I enjoy and that would be mostly missing without a camera flash. If not; I'll just have to accessorize.,11 months ago,Hi Brent; It is too early to tell to be honest; but I'll be sure to update/test as we get our EVT phones ready. I also am a flashlight user; and have a few great external ones as well; but agree it surely came in handy when I used my iPhone. I've thought about this same thing (whether or not I would need to accessorize or not) and will keep you posted. I have a feeling it will be helpful for reading a menu; but less so for navigating a dark room; but that's just a guess right now.
Thanks for your recent update; I'm really looking forward to getting it next year.,11 months ago,"Thanks Max; hope that all is well!

Hi Joe; Apologies for the late update; truth be told I'm now forgetting my phone; hopefully that won't be with the Light Phone 2 haha"
A very basic camera could be something for a next revision.I don't even need to see what I'm capturing.,11 months ago,Hi Marc; I totally agree; especially as a film photographer myself; I think there is something magical in the delayed reviewing of images. We've been intimidated to try a camera on our own as it's the engineering skills are not our current expertise internally; but perhaps we can work with a partner who is experienced in making cameras to develop a more 'light' appropriate camera. Cheers!
Thank you so much for designing this product! I hope that it will be an effective alternative to a smartphone. I recently downgraded to a flip phone which is awful. I recently ran into a challenge with it. I could not verify my identity with a credit card company. They sent an authorization code to my phone; but I could not tell them the code because the phone cannot check messages while calling. This might be an easy thing to overlook; but it is essential the LP2 can view texts while calling.,11 months ago,Thanks for sharing that very specific and relevant example. We've been working with many flip/feature phone users prior to even launching the campaign to learn of the ways in which we could vastly improve their experience with the Light Phone 2. I have taken note of this and will work with our developers to see if this will be possible within our current UX. Thanks for bringing this to my attention; cheers!
"Should the LP2 have contacts; audio playback; etc.; has there been consideration given to how such data will be uploaded to the phone? A grip I have with smartphones is their dependence on a ""hub"" program to sync to such as iTunes; which require unnecessary types computers to run those programs. The LP2 fits perfectly with my ""as simple as possible"" lifestyle; which is also why I prefer Chromebooks over other computers. In short: Will we see a Chrome and/or web-based LP software option?",11 months ago,"Hey! The Light Phone II will have an ""account hub"" so to speak for managing your phone and account; which with our current plans will be using a website dashboard viewable on any computer (or chromebook and even a smartphone). Cheers!"
+1 for Jeffrey Corgan. Very useful!!,11 months ago,:)
Love following the updates from this product team.Also; wanted to add my support behind Jeffrey Corgan's idea to have a special set of information displayed when battery is out (such as a couple emergency contact numbers).,11 months ago,Cheers Joseph; noted!
"Hi Team.I'm curious (in theory) about a customized ""fail"" screen; which the phone throws up right before running out of battery power. Much in the way other e-ink devices have icons to indicate needing a charge in this state; I imagine Light 2 could throw up critical; user-specified information: numbers of your top three emergency contacts; for example (or anything specified by the user in a text file)--rendering the device still useful when bricked.",11 months ago,"I shouldn't say ""bricked."" Out of power.

Hey Jeffrey; thanks for sharing this idea. It's quite interesting and definitely something we will take a note of. We'd love to take advantage of the E-ink screen unique properties like this as much as possible and I certainly don't find this to be a distraction. Love sharing this kind of ideas; thanks for adding to the community and hopefully even the final product! (currently we're still early in our development and will not be able to really push these ideas until later this year)

Thanks for keeping us in the loop."
Hey Joe; quick question. Do you think you could add a feature to flag text messages or mark them unread; as a reminder to return and answer them later? I do much of my business via text; so some way of reminding myself I have not responded to messages would be clutch. Thanks!,11 months ago,Hey! Interesting idea. I used to use a similar function for emails and found it very useful. I'm not sure how we would fit such a function into the Light Phone UX currently; but we haven't fully flushed out the various options for notifications; so it's too early for me to say yes for sure. We will definitely take this consideration with us as we continue to flush out the nuances. Cheers!
Hi Joe and team. Well done for pushing it forward and very confident with the July update. Wishing to see more surveys in terms of design choices; native apps and a lot more. A definite phone that I'm looking forward to in 2019. And you neva know it might become my primary one; considering the messaging service though.,11 months ago,Hi Ali; Hope that all is well!  The initial survey was so helpful. We made sure we accounted for the possibility of our future tools in our hardware planning and it guided our current software development and prioritization of next steps. There are certainly a lot of decisions that are constantly being made and it's not always possible to survey for every decision of course. I'm really excited to share the next two big updates for software and hardware and we plan a feedback survey then too.
Will we be able to hotspot our data off this phone?,11 months ago,Hi John; We have made sure that our hardware is capable of supporting the ability to hotspot and we do think it makes sense for certain users planning to use their Light Phone as an only phone in conjunction with a laptop/tablet. The only concern is around timeline as we are not sure yet whether or not such an optional tool will be available by April 2019 yet.
BTW; will there be a feature to use BT dialer so can make calls from a smartphone via the light phone2? Also be able to use BT contact sync once paired the 2 phones? The Fsmart M5 mini card Cell Phone has this feature.,11 months ago,Hi Sean; Hope all is well. Although we may technically be capable of building something like that with our current hardware; it's not currently on the horizon for us. We've seen that feature in a number of small phones; but honestly never quite understood it. If you had to have a smartphone near; then to us it seemed like the Light Phone was not necessary in that case. I'd be curious to learn about how you'd imagine yourself using that feature? Thanks for understanding.
Hey; is it theoretically possible to change from a black to a white Version?BestTimo,11 months ago,Yes; that's not a problem at all. In the coming weeks as we have more detailed images to share of each of the color ways; we hope it will make it easier to decide which color you would prefer; but you can totally make a switch at any point before we begin shipping.
When do we get to the next stage?,11 months ago,"Hello! Lots of exciting progress has been made. I think it makes sense to break the updates into categories: Software/UX ; Hardware/ID/spec; other administrative general updates and hope to have the one about software/UX end of week to start. A lot of our preliminary work; creating requirements documents; timelines; certification steps; etc. don't have a lot of interesting assets to share; but now that the ball is really rolling we'll have more and more tangible updates going forward. Cheers!

Thank you for your reply. I just think it's too long to wait until next April. Thanks!!!

Believe me; we would love to be shipping the Light Phone II now! The realities of building a phone from scratch are such that it's just not possible to deliver in less time. Thanks again for your support and understanding!"
I'm really happy to see the second version of the Light Phone!Please; realize the SDK. This not only saves your development time but also makes geeks very happy. I would like to be able to write a simple Telegram client for this phone. That's all I need.- E-Ink display means no backlight; so we won't be able to see the screen in the dark? - Transition from case to screen will be noticeable?,12 months ago,Hey! Understand re:SDK; especially as it will allow people to make their very specific tools they need; that we as Light may not prioritize relative to our larger user base needs. -There is a front light on the E-ink display-It can not be completely seamless; but we are trying our absolute best to make it as least noticeable as possible. Right now we're playing with screen printing around the E-ink screen to minimize the transition as much as possible. Will be able to share more of that soon!
Any chance the phone will be ahead of schedule?,12 months ago,Not impossible; there is definitely some buffer included in our timelines; but I'm hesitant to say so at this point. Cheers!
will there be contact syncing?,12 months ago,Yep; that's the goal. We asked everyone how they currently store their contacts so we could try our best to accommodate as many users as possible. Exact details of syncing is TBD. Thanks!!
Looking forward to the June Update. Will we be able to play music / listen to podcast and get directions at the same time?,12 months ago,"Hey Edgardo; Hope to have an update by end of week. The team has been traveling a lot to Taiwan to work closely with E-Ink and other manufacturing partners. We're still really focused on the core functionality; and until that gets built and tested out; we won't be diving too deep into the future tools like music. We have learning a little bit more about some music requirements for some collaborations (DRM for instance) and ensuring our phone can support the possibility...

As for doing both things at the same time; it's going to be really hard to multi-task with our current OS design which is based off our incredibly small screen (relative to smartphones at least). It's too early for me to say final answers regarding this at this point as there are too many unknowns with how music or directions may be handled. Thanks for understanding!"
Just jumped on and I'm really looking forward to this! One question: how is the music part being handled? Is it an app (can one use iTunes?) or something else? I'm not clear on how a playlist can be added.,12 months ago,"Hi Byron; Sorry for the confusion; but the reason we haven't clearly defined how the music part is being handled is because we have not yet dived into those features. We are ensuring we have basic DRM support within the Android we are using at our core. We want to offer options so there may be a few ""tools"" - i.e. one for just dragging songs you own onto device like a playlist to maybe collaborating w/ a streaming platform like Spotify. iTunes being proprietary is probably not possible.

Come closer to late fall/winter as we really get through our ""core functionality"" we'll be able to dive into the tools that users most desire and hopefully even be able to offer a few of them at the time of launch. At that time; I foresee lots of really interesting discussions with our backers over the details/needs/goals etc; but it's hard for us to go too deep before we comfortably build the base operating system. Hope that makes sense!"
Hi;  I see that the European company Punkt have just announced the second iteration of their simple phone; the MP02. The new phone seems to have a focus on functioning as a really secure wifi hotspot; so when you want to do more on a tablet/laptop you can. I'd love to see a similar angle from the Light Phone 2. Thanks for all your hard work! Cheers.,12 months ago,"Yep; we also saw about Punkt's second generation phone too. Although we have not yet begun really flushing out that as a tool; we have been ensuring that all of the hardware requirements for such a feature are readily available in our phone so that we can introduce something similar. Thanks for pointing that one out to us; can't wait to share more tangible updates soon!

Thanks for the reply Joe!"
Hi; Great job guys! :+1: Looking forward to getting my hands on the finished product. The only reason I currently need a smartphone is for Google Authenticator 2FA. Whether this could be integrated in some capacity or by means of facilitating developers to make their own integrations/apps that would be great! I'd like to think an open developer community could be a strong selling point for the light phone. :fingers_crossed:,12 months ago,Hi Joe! Thanks :) I'm not currently familiar with Authenticator 2FA. We do plan to create an SDK of sorts for people to develop their own tools that we may not be able to get to in a reasonable timeframe; however we don't have those exact details of that. My concern is if somehow there needs to be an NFC chip which is currently not in our hardware spec; or access to an underlying piece of the dialer software to make an Authenticator work; but again not sure sorry for not being more helpful.
I am sure that many backers agree that this phone not only has to be elegant (which I feel is perfect at the moment; my dream phone) but has to have durability to match. I have noticed that some have requested a removable battery. This is very important to me; so the phone is not disposable; a reaction against the throwaway practices common today. Is the battery an original design? Or are you still working on that one? Good Luck with the Light Phone II; Team Light!,12 months ago,Thank you very much for the support and taking the time to share this feedback and suggestions. Perhaps we can create a case to offset your concerns about dust; but it may be too late for us to really reconsider the mechanical design at this stage if we are to deliver on time. We are really trying our best to hit the balance of elegance and durability. It is very tricky and I really hope when we deliver your phone next year it is able to exceed your expectations :)
Additionally; a mesh that only allowed sound out; but shields against dust would be welcomed on the speaker area. This mesh/covering would have to be sealed; and must be such a tight weave that no microscopic dust particles would be able to get through. This is something else that is important; with your funding and time; I am sure this can be accomplished. If these suggestions are not possible; it would be perfect if the phone could be taken apart using a pin to be dusted and cleaned.,12 months ago,
Hello!I would like to make a suggestion regarding one of the problems that could be improved in this phone. Dust frequently jams up speakers and buttons on phones today. A rubber outer layer on the sides of the phone could seal the button gap areas and eliminate dust problems; much like the Unihertz Atom; the buttons are part of the case; rather than separate parts; increasing durability. You could keep the aluminum buttons; but have them slightly more set-in with a rubber layer on top.,12 months ago,
Hi guys!Have you considered making the phone water resistant? Since the phone is going to be more of a secondary phone; it would be really nice if the phone could be in damp places or exposed to sweat without damage. I can imagine many people using the phone for jogging etc. Furthermore; will we have the option to change the battery ourself's? Let's say the battery is not working; would we have to send it in to service or could we just order a new battery? Regards,12 months ago,Hi Peter; Water resistance I agree would be a wonderful touch. Being that the E-Ink screen is really perfectly suited for being outside; I can see how it may come with users for more outdoor adventures which may involve the phone getting wet. It's a little too early for us to promise it yet; but we're even exploring what it would take to be waterproof.  The battery is not user removable and would need to be serviced most likely.
Hello! I just preordered the light phone 2; vary excited! I have a question: If you do decide to include directions; do you know if there will be public transportation directions too? Also; will you be able to lock the phone with a pass code?,12 months ago,Hi Diana! Thanks for the support; can't wait to share the Light Phone with you :) There is an option to add a passcode for the phone; yep; that's already in our current design. I cannot yet speak 100% to the directions app; but I can say that we think public transit info is really important and something we (in nyc ourselves) would love to use and see in the directions tool too.
Is it still your intent to use BackerKit?,12 months ago,Yes that's still the plan!
Can I change for white??? Please ???,12 months ago,That's not a problem; I've made a note on our backend for the change; unfortunately it will not reflect in your Indiegogo pledge. We will follow up to confirm color preferences and up to date shipping address prior to sending out the phones. Thanks again for the support!
"Hey Guys! Amazing project; I went back to a dumb phone this year after realizing the devastating effects those things have on our relationships- mine and my students. However; it is a real sacrifice when I do much of my business via text and the majority of older phones are not set up to handle group messages or media- will this handle group messages/media? Second; would you ever consider a simple to-do list feature? ""Things 3"" was one of the few truly useful apps on my smart phone. Thanks!",12 months ago,Thanks!! We do want to have a nice solution for group texts and are exploring our options now. One of the tricky things is just how small the screen is; but we hope to find an adequate design solution. Media messages we are less sure about as we don't really intend to show images on the device; but perhaps maybe just a warning that an image was sent. Still TBD. Would be open to considering a to-do-list function for sure; will check out Things 3 thanks for sharing that example.
Have you considered making the phone compatible with external antennae? It wouldnt take up much extra room and it would increase functionality for many people; as well as make it more accessible.,12 months ago,"Hi David! Thanks for bringing this idea up. Although we haven't yet had the time to deeply explore what external accessories may be possible for the phone; we have tried our best to ensure that our hardware components within the phone support these kinds of ""smart"" external cases (I know the word smart gets tossed around a lot; but accessories that do more than just charge is what I mean) by making sure our USB port and chipset support OTG. We see lots of potential in this for the future."
Hi Joe; what is the purpose of the up; down button? Will we only be able to use these two buttons to type a text message; or will we be able to touch the screen to make an input? If we can touch the screen to input a  text; way wouldn't we be able scroll through the home screen by touching the screen instead of pushing on the up/down buttons. Thanks!,12 months ago,"Hi Edgardo; thanks for asking this. The phone is touch screen; so for things like texting you will be able to input using a QWERTY keyboard on the screen. The buttons ser e as an easier means to navigate the menus was our thinking. Because the screen is so small and we want it to have as little clutter as possible; we felt dedicated menu buttons would make navigating the phone much simpler in quick; day to day use. The buttons also serve as volume while the phone is on a call for instance.

sorry for the typo... "" The buttons serve as an easier..."""
Its funny that we refer to his as a dumb phone. When in reality it is a get back to what is important phone.,1 year ago,"well said! The ""dumb phone"" term never really felt right in terms of what we felt we were trying to achieve; but I understand it is the opposite of a ""smart phone"" so it kind of worked. I like the ""get back to what is important phone"" much better :)"
Hi Joe; Im super pumped to go light in Q1 next year. Love the design and the concept of ditching my smartphone...maybe for good. I had a question about my preorder. I ordered black but Id like to change my preference to the white color. Is this possible? Thanks again. -Chris,1 year ago,Hey Chris! That's not a problem; I can make a note on our end now; but just an FYI for everyone that we will be following up to confirm shipping addresses and color preference prior to shipping the phone early next year; so if in our development as we are able to share more detailed photos of the two color options we imagine many users might want to change their minds and that is totally fine! Cheers
Hi looking forward to recieving my light phone 2! I live in Denmark and plan to use this as my primary phone. Can you confirm that you will include these danish letters:   ?,1 year ago,Hi Robert; Thanks for the support! I totally understand your concerns about those letters and I imagine that we will be able to support them; but I will not be able to 100% confirm it for a few months. I'm confident however that we will in fact have those characters; thanks for understanding.
As someone who is still using a dumb (or uninformed :D) phone and enjoying it; I was wondering if the Light phone would require a data plan. Also; I would be super interested if it would have a basic PDF reading system for eBooks...,1 year ago,
Is Sim Toolkit available on the device? In my country they use the phone to login to banks. I see a tool app on the sim called a SIM Toolkit that allows us to authenticate with the bank by providing a specific code and a digit on the phone screen. Will this be visible on the screen of the phone? Please have a look when you have time.,1 year ago,Hello! Thank you for the support and bringing this to our attention. To be honest; I am not familiar with it and we will have to do some investigating with our software team before I can provide an accurate answer.  Thanks for understanding! On the original Light Phone we have a menu item for viewing the various information of the phone and SIM (IMEI; SIM #; etc); so we can likely do this there; I just want to verify that it will be possible before committing to that.
Less is more. If I wanted a smartphone that does all those things that people are requesting; then I have my iPhone. The key with Light Phone 2 is not to have any extra additional features; not even ones that you can install. AS an example; with my iPhone; I could delete a ton of apps and make it into a Light Phone 2; but the issue is that I can (and do) reinstall all those apps again. The key for Light Phone 2 would be not to have those apps in the first place.,1 year ago,This is a very valid point. Obviously the fear in allowing a user to install additional 'tools' is that it could become a smartphone. I think another important thing the Light Phone has on its side is that it is so intentionally limited with it's hardware (black and white screen and it is quite small) that many of the most troublesome apps (social media) would never really translate; even if you had the option. I guess a long way of saying I'm confident that our tools will remain utilitarian.
The design is really good; every time I see it I fall more in love with the simplicity and elegance; however at the same time very powerful for core functionality. Unfortunately; at the time of writing this my uncle is obsessed with checking if he has a new message on Facebook from his partner; amazes me how the phycological engineering has lost some forever; however; with the light phone there is at least some hope.,1 year ago,
Hey guys! I hope you will listen to my suggestion of having a simple pass-time game on the phone. Something like a sudoku; chess; or something more unique like a letterpress-like game adapted to the e-ink screen would be amazing. I obviously don't want a gaming device but something timeless to kill time when the bus is late would be super awesome. You could even involve the community :),1 year ago,"Hello Laurent; thanks for the support! This is not the first time we've heard this from backers and I think at least at some point offering the option to install such pass-time games isn't necessarily hypocritical to the idea of the phone. I know in my creative process; sometimes doing something like a sudoku can help  me ""unstuck"" myself; simply by doing something mindless and letting my mind wander. I can see the counter-argument as well; and that's why making the tools optional is important."
Has there been enough data collected from the surveys to share some insight with us ?,1 year ago,Yep; hope to share an update before our end of the day today!
Hey Light Team! Preordered and pumped to ditch the smartphone. I would love to take the survey as well just to put my 2 cents in; any chance you could send one along to me? Looking good so far! Keep it up!,1 year ago,Will do; we'd love to have your 2 cents included of course. Sorry for the inconvenience; but Indiegogo can't automatically send out the survey to new backers; we have to do so manually... sending now!
Hi all - I have pre ordered the phone but would love to actually order a second one for my best friend. Are there add ons or do I have to order a second time with double the postage? Thanks x Pia,1 year ago,HI Pia; thanks for the support! I'm going to email you privately to the email associated with your pledge so we can try to find a solution for you. Currently there is not yet a way within Indiegogo to support that automatically; but we'd love to get you a second phone for your friend and agree it doesn't make sense to send them separately!
I'm really excited about the LP2!  I have a quick question regarding messaging capability: I know the LP2 will support SMS; but will it support any MMS capabilities (group messaging; pictures; etc)?  Obviously images would be relatively limited on the e-ink screen; but seems like that might be possible.  If this is still TBD; no problem.  Thanks!,1 year ago,"Hey Kevin! Thanks for the support! It is still TBD in terms of exact details. We do want to find a nice solution for group messages and images; but haven't gotten to really dive into what our options will be just yet. Thanks for keeping this top of mind though; I think how we resolve this is a very crucial piece of the phone's ""core functionality"" as we have been referring to it; especially for users that plan to use the Light Phone as their primary device. Cheers"
Forgot to put this on my survey response but audiobooks (audible) and podcast functionality would be amazing!,1 year ago,Thanks for sharing; Daniel; and I totally see how that would be useful for you as a user. We are concerned about our ability to partner with platforms such as Audible (seems like it will require permission/negotiations/participation on their part to work out); but we will hopefully find a solution suitable for all. Thanks for understanding!
Im exited about the 2... as a current original light phone user it will be nice to have the 4g service reliability. Is it possible for me to take the survey as well? More curious to what questions are being asked than me needing anything... a phone with text is all I need! Longer battery life and reliable service is all I need to make it my primary phone. Thanks for making this happen!,1 year ago,"Re-sending the survey now to the email with your Indiegogo backing! Totally agree re: 4G service reliability; can't wait. The survey was a way to learn a little bit more about how our users plan to use their phone and if we were able to offer additional (and always optional!) features; which ones would be priority. We'll be sharing our learnings shortly; it's been a busy few weeks of kicking off all our various partners.  I think the Light Phone II will be perfect for your needs; looking forward

One thing I would enjoy is having the option to turn recieving text messages off and/or having an auto reponse to text informing them I have gone light and they will need to call me if they need anything urgently.

I completely agree and we definitely plan to have a simple auto-reply option for the Light Phone 2. The only thing to remember is that if you are using the Light PHone as a secondary phone; the auto-reply would need to be set on your smartphone which is out of our control. It's tricky with iPhones but we shared a hack you can read about here: https://medium.com/the-light-phone/setting-up-an-away-message-fd3efd856f0b . If you are using the Light Phone as your only phone; this isn't an issue"
As a dumb phone user for the past 4 years; I love that if I drop it it's going to be okay. I can imagine dropping this little credit card sized phone often. Hope final solution is robust enough to be dropped 100s times over it's life and still function as it did originally. I know there's discussion about a case. It would be neat if case was a simple wallet (functional/highly protective). Replaceable battery would be +++.,1 year ago,"If there is a case; could be a journal (think moleskin) or simple a wallet; with pouch for phone. When I think of iPhone cases; I find them so useless. They don't even really protect the phones half of the time and they serve no other purpose. I love the idea behind your packaging for light phone 1. If you make a case; I think you should stay true to this idea.

Thanks Edgardo for sharing this feedback and ideas. The ways in which a case can add actual utility is definitely interesting. We too; haven broken smartphones before; miss the durability of flip phones and hope that we can deliver something substantial and resistant to normal drops. Cases of course being another way to make the phone even more durable (one that would actually protect the phone!). Can't wait to share the Light Phone II with you!"
"The ""light"" ethos is a wonderful one; and important to stick to. Obviously a mountain of features that cancel out the idea of ""going light"" is tantamount to making a smartphone with an e-ink screen; which is counterproductive. And while different users will have different needs; it's equally pointless to make a phone that most users will dump in a desk drawer; or keep forgetting to use because its severely limited functionality makes it just one more cumbersome device to manage.",1 year ago,"Personally; I intend to make LP2 my primary phone and keep my SIM-less smartphone at home as a kind of little tablet. My emails; internet browser; and soul crushing social media feeds can wait until I'm either at home or work. What I'd ask the devs to keep in mind are the practicalities of using the LP2 on a daily basis. The dreamy aspirations of suddenly being phone-free in a rainforest and listening to birdsong; or striking up conversations with fascinating people in hip coffee shops...

... is a nice way to visualize the ""light"" ethos but won't reflect most people's needs. In reality; most of us will use the LP2 to enable a (temporary) escape from our endless emails and toxic social media feed addictions; but will nonetheless do so in noisy; crowded cities that we don't always want to be experiencing in full force. Features like maps; music; and a calendar can help ensure that we're not just initially thrilled with a new; lighter lifestyle...

... but will actively keep coming back to the LP2. I am confident that the devs will strike a balance that will allow daily users to feel lighter without also feeling unmoored.

This was incredibly detailed feedback that touches upon a lot of important points. Thanks for sharing this so clearly with us. That very question you pose of how do we make sure it has enough that users actively come back to the phone is our priority; especially taking our learnings from our initial Light Phone. The experience needs to be reliable and trustworthy of being one's daily driver; even if functionality is relatively limited. Can't wait to share the Light Phone 2 with you!"
I wouldn't mind seeing NFC for Android Pay. Would be cool to go light and maybe even leave my wallet at home too. Not sure if its really in scope of the project but maybe someone knows someone at google and they could build in a simple Android Pay integration. I mean its not hard to grab one credit card along with this and keys but NFC along with bluetooth could open opportunities to leave keys at home too. Just some thoughts,1 year ago,"ALthough there are no immediate features we plan to devlop that would need NFC we can understand how having the chip in the phone might open future possibilities; whether it be the use case you mention of making payments/unlocking doors or other purposes we haven't yet thought of. The form factor is pretty packed; and NFC isn't our immediate priority; but it is in fact of a list of speculative ""would be nice to have the option"" sensors for Light Phone II. Thanks for understanding!"
Not having QR-codes as in not being able to open for instance the ticket to a movie; or QR-reader? The latter I never use; but being able to open the movie-ticket instead of sending to my girlfriend; or whoever is joining; is handy; but not a must-have :),1 year ago,Nikolai; thanks for chiming in. To the best of my knowledge; as a non-QR code user myself; we'd need a camera to read QR codes which the Light Phone will not have. In terms of displaying them; that may be possible within our hardware limitations but I would agree that it does not seem like a must-have feature at all. Perhaps there is a middle ground that can accommodate users who use them often; but it's not on our immediate priorities. Thanks again for supporting our project!!
"I see some discussion about having/not having QR codes. Coming from someone that doesn't even own a smartphone; I'd really like the ability to ""print"" PDFs of simple documents; like movie tickets with QR code; to the phone. Why? Simple; I just want to save paper.  Having this option doesn't prevent you from saving a movie ticket you buy in person if you want to use it in a scrap book. I also don't see myself getting distracted by QR codes while eating out with the family.",1 year ago,"I do wonder about distraction by music/podcasts via mp3 function. I really do want this function (long road trips; commutes; maybe while working out; or on a walk); but before the iPhone there was the iPod. I can see how it may be nice to have some background music playing while at a BBQ at the park; but also how it may prevent people from striking a convo with someone new. While I really would like the feature; I can see why it may be left out.

The music/podcast feature is the most tricky that we are exploring because it sits on the line of really useful and also maybe a huge distraction that contradicts the idea of going light. Unlike other tools like directions; which serve a clear purpose; music does not really fair well with the philosophy of being designed to be used as little as possible. That being said; I was just at a loud train station over the weekend and having the option to drown out the noise so I could read was welcomed"
Today's edition of the times of India featured an article that mentioned the light phone 2 :),1 year ago,"So cool! Is there a link you can share or was it only in print?

Only in print so far."
As a Light Phone 1 user; I intend to use this device as little as possible; and in the midst of all the Data Scandals that are currently being unraveled; I want to stem away from tech as much as possible and keep only the essentials. Phone; GPS; Texting; Rideshare; Music player is a nice feature; Bluetooth I suppose to only stream music from; but the other long list of features; QR codes; really? Weather?  Look outside.  These features  push this phone towards it being an E-Ink smart phone.,1 year ago,"Thanks Richard for supporting us with the original Light Phone as well! I can assure you that we do not wish to make this device a smartphone by any means. The phone will ship with just what we refer to as ""core functionality"" and for many users they will never need to see/install additional ""tools"" at all.  Although I agree that I have never used a QR code in my life; we want to remain open to understanding everyone's needs and seeing how we can support them within our capabilities. Cheers!"
"Light Phone 1 was meant to be a 2nd phone that relied on forwarding. Light Phone 2 does not come with a SIM and will require it's own phone plan. You may choose to go light ""more often; or for good"". Given this; people are going to have different opinions about which tools to include. With the information from the survey I have confidence that Light will thread the needle between too much and too little to the best of their ability.",1 year ago,Thanks; Bradley. That was well said; it's definitely a balancing act and I'm currently working on an update with some mocks of ways we imagine allowing the users to customize the phone to their exact needs (and nothing more!). We really push for simplicity but understand that everyone has different needs and will try our best to accommodate all of our users. The surveys are really helpful and in general it seems that everyone wants less than more features which is great news! Hope alls well!
Going light is an excellent concept and the developers of this phone have asked that we as contributors let them know about tools that are useful and not distracting. The aim of light phone 2; as far as I understand; is to provide a set of tools that would allow us to break away from the clutches of social media and other such distractions. Having said that I feels that hotspot and QR come under the purview of tools and not distractions.,1 year ago,
Instead I think it would be more prudent and effective to look at what functionality you need for the day and choose your phone accordingly. As a student I plan to have my light phone with me during days where I have lectures and papers to write and use my old smartphone for weekends or spending time with friends or family. Either way I think that it is critical to have a less is more mentality as the more is added to the light phone; the less effective the original vision of the light team gets,1 year ago,"Very well said Oswaldo. We used to like to use the metaphor of comparing the Light Phone and smartphone balance to how we have different shoes or jackets for different days as well. Although we do understand that some users want to eliminate the smartphone altogether; which is powerful; and may need a few more functions; we really see this as a ""lighter"" phone (less is more mentality) and it is not pretending to be a smartphone at all :) thanks for chiming in!"
"I think some contributors are missing the point of the original proposal by the light team; this phone is meant not as a full replacement of our traditional smartphones but a mere supplement. Adding more functionality like qr and hotspots while do not directly make the light phone more prone to being ""connected"" it still indirectly takes us away from the ability to be disconnected that was in essence the entire purpose of the light phone.",1 year ago,
"Cheers Stephen.  Using our phone as a hotspot to enable us to spend more time staring at a laptop screen instead of say; interacting with those around us; admiring the view outside the window; thinking about how to surprise a loved one with an unexpected gift; etc.;  sounds decidely ""un-Light"" to me.  Whatever our opinions on features though; I think this is a very important conversation to have at this point and I hope the developers will provide an appropriate forum for the discussion",1 year ago,"I appreciate the back and forth a lot; and thanks for keeping the comments very civil; everyone will not be able to agree on everything of course. The forum I was working on is pretty much ready; I wanted to do more testing and have put it briefly on pause as we kick off all our development efforts with our various partners; but hope to have that for us soon. As for discrepancy between features; I plan to have some mocks ready for our next update with ways we imagine being able to...

customize the Light Phone II to one's exact needs. The reality is we have different ""types"" of users with very different needs. I totally see your point about hotspot being un-light in that instance; but can also relate to being stuck at an airport and using my smartphone hotspot to be productive on my laptop. Not a very light experience; but I can see how people using the Light Phone as their only phone may want that option. We hope that by making the phone customizable; it can suite all needs."
"Light is supposed to be distraction-free. QR code display is perfectly in the Light philosophy. I'm not going to be opening the QR code app to see what QR codes my friends are scanning; and how many likes we all have.Ditto with hotspot - it's not a distraction; it's a feature. Why should I be forced; if I'm on a train trying to use my laptop; to take my SIM card out of my LP2 and ""go get an iPhone"" when the LP2 will be an Android-based device that's technically capable of being a hotspot?",1 year ago,"Finally; I expect the base experience for the LP2 will be very ... light. I don't think anyone need worry about being overwhelmed with preinstalled tripe.But I very much hope we can write&sideload Light-UX apps (be v. disappointed if it's needlessly locked down). For example; my bank has an API and I could write a simple app to check my balance or transfer money. Obviously not everyone will want it; but it would fit my expectations on a Light phone: simple clean utility; without distractions.

I think the point of the Light Phone II not being ""overwhelmed with preinstalled tripe"" is very important to us. The phone will ship with what we are calling core functionality. Any additional features would need to be ""installed"" on the phone by the user intentionally. We don't want to ever force any feature on users unwillingly; and hope that this way we can satisfy everyones needs without taking away from users that don't want any additional features AT ALL."
I'll chime in here. Looking through the comments- hotspots; QR codes; guys that defeats the point of what Light is. If I need a hotspot to work from my device; I'm obviously not Light. If I'm using my cell phone to board a plane rather than use a printed pass; again; not Light. Don't bastardize this concept. People asking for these features; why bother? Go get an iPhone.,1 year ago,Thanks; Dan. We are definitely pushing for less than more in terms of functionality. We do however; appreciate understanding what things people want on their phone; although it may not be possible to ever view a QR code on the Light Phone II; we want to be empathetic to the fact that there are a variety of different users that may want very different things. That being said; we are in no means trying to build a smartphone; this is a light phone designed to be used as little as possible! Cheers
"In reading through a lot of the comments below; feature creep is already emerging.  I urge you to stick to your guns and deliver a truly light phone; sans a bunch of convenient but non-essential addons.  In deciding what features to include; I'd start with ""no go""; unless an extremely compelling case can be made for its inclusion - one that is consistent with your mission of spending quality time free from digital distraction.",1 year ago,"Understand your concerns completely; it's something we had to come to terms with even with the inclusion of messaging from original Light Phone to Light Phone II. I think by making all of the additional features optional; requiring the user to intentionally ""install"" them we can keep the phone experience perfectly trimmed to our individual needs. At the moment we are razor focused on the core phone functionality and that is where our priority is.  All additional features are still TBD."
"Hola--maybe it's too late; but the link to the survey seems to have been eaten by my (jealous?) fancy phone. Is there a way to access it? If not; my answer to every question is probably ""LESS""...",1 year ago,An important answer to have included! I'll re-email you the survey now to the email provided to us with your backing. Cheers Geoffrey; hope that all is well.
Will Wi-Fi calling/texting be a feature of this phone supports? I would find that incredibly useful. Where I work I have almost no reception; but we have wi-fi; so it would be great to still be able to make calls and text without the need of a cell signal.,1 year ago,It would be great to support wiFi calling and something we aspire to do; but at this early in the development I am not sure how complicated that will be to achieve or not so I'm hesitant to promise it as a feature just yet. Thanks for understanding and we appreciate you bringing that point to our attention as we obviously want the phone to work for everyone.
Just a thought - will it be possible to store two phone numbers for the same contact - I.e. a home phone (landline) number and a mobile phone number?,1 year ago,We haven't 100% flushed that aspect out; but that was our plan; thanks for pointing that out!
"Sorry if this has question has been asked and answered; but I'm wondering if you have contemplated offering a calendar. That's been the most difficult piece of my own ""dumb phone"" migration; and it would be a great enticement to many who find themselves dependent upon digital calendars. Thanks for this great project. I look forward to getting mine when it's available.",1 year ago,"It's definitely being considered! We are currently digesting the survey results and trying to understand what additional tools to prioritize in our development aside from the core functionality. One question we didn't ellaborate on in the survey is regarding what calendar functionality people need - is it simple a calendar to see the dates w/ no events? Is it just a snapshot of my next three calendar events? Or do people want a full fledged digital calendar that can add new events etc.;;

Thanks for the response. My personal hope would be to have it be a full-fledged calendar; which would allow me to avoid carrying another device. One more thing: is the survey closed or is it still possible to complete it? Thanks again.

Thanks for quick response. Will re-mail survey to you now; whenever you get a few minutes; we'd love to have you be a part of it! We do want to synthesize and share the results thus far with everyone but we also get a few more replies daily. It's not terribly time sensitive as our software/hardware teams are focused and working on the core functionality before we can actually dive into the details (timelines/prioritization & feasibility & design/functionality) of additional tools. Cheers!"
I am using Verizon as my carrier It would be great if it has the ability to use Verizon Messages+ (which stores your messages in the cloud) that way the text messages don't take up the entire memory and you can sync the messages between phones.Is that something that you would consider?,1 year ago,We'd love to explore all ways to make the phone work well for our various types of users. I am not familiar with Verizon Messages + specifically and it may require their cooperation for Light Phone to be compatible; but if it were possible with in our constraints then we'd love to work with it. Until we are able to explore that further; I'm unable to confirm right now that it will be. It may prove to work just with your Verizon SIM without any Light customization as well; which would be great.
Sorry if this is a repeat/obvious question but is the light phone 2 going to have a silent/vibrate mode?,1 year ago,Yep!
Although I've never been in a situation where I couldn't have a ticket printed; I can respect the desire to have QR. There are probably some scanners that wouldn't be able to read the inverted code on the black LP2.,1 year ago,I think we could work around the inverted colors by always showing the QR code in it's correct format (like an image file) so regardless of the color model it would need to work fine. That is assuming we decide to include a way to view QR codes which isn't necessarily guaranteed yet; although I can also respect the desire to have it. Personally I love a physical boarding pass that I can keep in my chest pocket and not have to fiddle with a phone at the gate; but hey that's just me.
I would echo earlier comments on the utility of QR codes; which would be super useful for travelling (boarding passes). The Talkase T3; a Chinese 'card phone'; doubles as hot spot to share its (in this case 3G) connection with other devices. Might this also be something worth considering?,1 year ago,Yep; a hot spot feature is something we have been seeing a pretty big interest from our users in and we will be exploring it's feasibility in our upcoming development. Thanks!
So... Hows is it going LIGHT? Any updates you would like to share or any progress made so far?,1 year ago,
If the light phone can display simple jpegs; then it solves a the problem of QR code.,1 year ago,"In theory; the phone is capable of displaying images; we've jsut been incredibly hesitant in considering how to integrate that which we have not fully flushed out in our interface designs. Thanks!

Good to know. The only place that I am looking for QR code is movie tickets which have small QR codes to begin with. QR code for flight tickets are not yet globally accepted and also I definitely watch more movies than I travel and not having to print movie tickets Everytime would be a really good plus :)"
QR CODE: I use my overloaded smart phone for my boarding pass twice a week. So QR can be read off a cell phone glass display. If LP2 could store images to be used for a lock display (rotating pictures while phone is locked) that would make the LP2 a work of art when NOT used.,1 year ago,
One person's view of the hunt; from The Verge: (includes the first Light Phone) https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/3/17304466/minimalist-light-phone-nokia-3310-unihertz-jelly-punky-mp01,1 year ago,
Auto correct typing and the ability to turn that feature on and off would be a nice add. Although I appreciate LP2s clean look and text only interface; I wonder if you'd be open to designing a handful of different artistic lock screens. I get that you don't want to make the phone too enticing; but the option to put a line drawn mountain; a tree or something funky and abstract might give us the opportunity to express ourselves ever so slightly. Maybe do a competition for a free phone. Cheers!,1 year ago,I like the idea of different lock screens ideas. On one hand the black adn white limitation would keep it from being too distracting. We imagined at least a variety of clock (or no time if you'd prefer) options that could live on the lock screen; but I had not considered other imagery. That will be fun to explore; thanks for sharing!
Cam I change my color from white to black?? So excited to get this~,1 year ago,Yep! We'll be on-boarding (via upcoming e-mail) everyone to a system called Backerkit so that anyone can change their address/phone color preferences at any point prior to our shipping.
"QR code: ""E-paper displays create a visible image by reflecting ambient light off the white particles (and not reflecting it off the black ones); in exactly the same way that a printed barcode is visible to the eye or a scanner. LCDs; by contrast; arent reflective. They work by passing light through a layer of liquid crystal; so certain types of scanner may not be able to determine the difference between areas our eyes perceive as dark and light."". I read this in an article online :)",1 year ago,Thanks for sharing those details; that is important to note that it is possible with the E-Ink screen. Appreciate it! Hope that all is well.
I missed the survey; but one thing I would really like is Signal support (I realise its highly improbable :)Or; a way to run custom code on it; so I can implement it myself,1 year ago,Hi Alva; sending you a survey to your email! We've talked to some of the people behind Signal and they were very realistic about the incredible amount of development work necessary for such an integration and whether or not it would even be possible. We have not given up; but want to be honest about how it may not be possible in our short term development plans. Cheers!
"A flashlight should not be a top five essential ""tool"" for going ""light"" as puny as that reads lol",1 year ago,As much as I love the idea of a flashlight; it does not seem possible for us to squeeze that into our current form factor. I plan to look into small keychain lights that I can always carry with me; and they will probably be more effective that a phone light too. Thanks for understanding!
Topic: QR CODE***E-ink display's don't have too many resolutions; so they can display all barcode scanners modules... very low resolution it means the barcode symbol ends up quite big. Every barcode reader; whether pens and laser scanners; measure the reflection of light. So it is impossible to read out the barcodes from the monitor as the plastic or glass will not reflect the light to the reader. So according to this; it is hard to read out barcodes on e-ink display by laser-based scanners.,1 year ago,
"I've already posted on this forum please click SHOW MORE to read previous posts******To the ""Battery Issue"" comments: An e-ink screen has the massive advantage over LCD and other modern screens in the fact that they do not utilize pixels; but rather white/black capsules that are negative or positively charged. This tech saves battery like crazy. Therefore a massive battery taking up vital real estate in this already tiny case isn't necessary...",1 year ago,
Hi Joe; I've used a LG C935 for 4 years (formerly iPhone 3GS.) Light Phone II is a dream come true. I almost went back to a smartphone just to be able to listen to podcasts/audiobooks for long road trips w/ my daughter; & to get directions. It's embarrassing to always ask for directions. Please incorporate directions; and the ability to play .mp3 & .aax. Having the ability save a .pdf to the device would be nice for movie tickets or a map. Nice to have would be a voice recorder to capture ideas.,1 year ago,Hi Edgardo! Thanks for the support and really glad that our project crossed paths with you. Directions seems to be the overwhelming priority from our backers thus far; and I appreciate the other feedback you shared as well. It's great to have that perspective of coming not from a smartphone. Hope that all is well!
Hi Joe and the team; thanks for making this concept into a reality! One concern though; i've not yet received the survey. I've checked my spam folder; checked my settings in indiegogo where I had already ticked the box to recieve news from this project. Can you send me the survey again? I've also tried to add the email to my contacts so now it'll probably work. Thank you!,1 year ago,"My bad; found a working survey

Sorry for not seeing this comment earlier; you can also always email us at info@thelightphone.com for a more immediate response; but glad to hear you were able to find the survey!"
Just thinking of a use-case: Movie tickets that I booked online and which would require me to display a QR code at the entrance.,1 year ago,
"Hey; I recently ""pre-ordered"" to support the cause; will I be able to get a survey or participation within the development?",1 year ago,HI Eric; Will email you using the address from your contribution with the survey; thanks for the support!
Oh man! I forgot to mention a desirable feature on my survey. Flashlight. Pure utility and oh so convienent at times.,1 year ago,Totally see where you're coming from. I was pushing for one too. I don't think Kaiwei felt it made as much sense/would be able to fit in our super cramped little phone so in all honesty it may not be possible. I've already explored a few super small flashlights that I'll probably end up using on my keys in addition to my Light Phone. Thanks for sharing this though!
Just want to back Roy Lo's comment about battery life. This is extremely important - reliability of battery means that 9/10 times if you can pick up the light phone without thinking twice will do wonders for incorporating it into my life.Completed my survey too; thanks for being so inclusive of your backers! Very excited for next years ship (fingers crossed).,1 year ago,Thanks Nicholas; and noted re: battery. We learned a lot from the first Light Phone and having a large battery was important to almost all of our users and something we hope we will deliver a suitable solution for!
I filled out the survey but I don't think there was anything about battery life.  My friend just got his Light Phone 1 and says the battery life was terrible; would not even last a day.  Please do not repeat the same mistake with Light Phone 2.  I would MUCH rather have a thicker phone than deal with a dead battery.  With e-ink it would be nice if we could reach 1990s level of technology and not have to charge it more than once a week!,1 year ago,Hi Roy; Thanks for sharing this point. There was no question about battery life on the survey because the survey was focused on the things we can continue to develop with software; where as hardware is relatively fixed. Battery life was the weakest point of the original Light Phone and something we learned a lot from and will definitely take seriously. I personally agree re:thickness and increasing battery size. Thanks for sharing that feedback!
I ordered a white one and have one concern. Back in 2013 when I got a white Jolla phone with a matte black finish; it turned to off-white (yellowish) in a few months; of course; because of usage. So will it be the same with the white light phone? And if its glossy; we would definitely need a cover so it doesn't slip a lot. Just had a thought!,1 year ago,
"Was just browsing through some news and feeds on youtube where i saw an unpaid video about LP2 with a title ""The worlds best ""simple"" phone."" I was actually happy to see how how people are taking this concept and are looking forward to it. M super excoted as well to have this piece of tech for myself and getbrid of fb for a start.. :-)",1 year ago,
Hello. I just backed the campaign and would love to take the survey if it is available for me. Thanks!,1 year ago,Will shoot you an email; cheers!
Checked my spam and junk folders and still no sign of the survey. I want to contribute!,1 year ago,"Hmm.. very strange as I checked your account and your email was in fact on our list of outgoing mail. I manually just forwarded the survey to the email provided on your Indiegogo account. If you don't see that; can you verify that your email associated with your account is correct? Thanks!

Got it! Thanks Joe!"
completed the survey and just thought of one more feature that I make use of a lot: location sharing,1 year ago,Noted!
One thing that was pretty cool about the survey was the idea of message integration of services like whatsapp. Still dont know how thats gonna happen but its good to hear that its been considered. :-),1 year ago,We've done some explorations and so far it seems like it's quite the development undertaking; but we of course want to see if we can somehow make it work. We wanted to gauge how many users would be really interested in such an integration and what platforms they were using. Glad you liked it!
The survey was spot on; brother!,1 year ago,Cheers! Glad to hear it
Will contacts be able to be pulled in and kept in sync from an outside source? ie. google; apple; etc.,1 year ago,Yep; that's one reason why on the survey we wanted to see where people currently store their contacts so we can try to address easy syncing for all... cheers!
Please share with us the results.,1 year ago,planning on it; sorry for not pointing that out!
When exactly was the survey sent out because I haven't got the email yet? I checked the spam folder as well.,1 year ago,It was about 15 minutes (give or take) before sending the Indiegogo update. That's weird; I will manually re-add and forward you the survey now; sorry for the inconvenience.
Hehe yeah Dubai is very tricky with carriers so just wanted to make sure.,1 year ago,
Will the survey results be made public at some time? Or will they be internal only?,1 year ago,Yep! I forget to mention that so thanks for calling it out; but I think it makes sense to share the quantifiable results with everyone.
I wasnt exactly clear about the carrier option in the survey; but please make it unlocked carrier free. :-),1 year ago,Totally! It will be unlocked; I guess we just wanted to be able to give users who's carriers were not technically compatible (on a network frequency level) a heads up.
I forgot to ask in my survey:Is it set-in-stone that the buttons will be on the right side of the phone? I ask because I've had different phones with buttons on either side; and I've come to believe that having buttons on the left side is better because: 1) the majority of the world (myself included) is right-handed and 2) when holding the phone in your right hand mid-call; you will have 2+ fingers on the left side of the phone (corresponding to 2 buttons); but only 1 (thumb) on the bottom. :),1 year ago,"Not 100% set in stone; but hardware changes are going to be more complex and with larger impacts to things like timeline and engineering costs than software (we have a lot of buffer timeline included for such changes and changing the buttons sides is potentially an easier change that adding a new port etc). But that feedback is interesting and something we will definitely consider seriously. Maybe there is a way we can make a shareable pdf foldable paper prototype for more feedback?

Great thought; Joe. That might work. I'm all about rapid prototyping and Usability. You might also be able to capture that data through the survey; with people's responses (i.e. any iPhone users will fall under the category of ""buttons on the left side""; and any users of Sony Xperia would fall under ""buttons on the right""; etc.). Shouldn't be too hard to compile that data; I would imagine.Or you could just compile data from the most-owned smartphones (and other phones)..."
"*Everyone: please take note!*An e-ink screen has the massive advantage over LCD and other modern screens in the fact that they do not utilize pixels; but rather white/black capsules that are negative or positively charged. This tech saves battery like crazy......but only when the screen doesn't have to put in ""motion work"" i.e. change what it is displaying.When simply scrolling up or down through menu/tools we are charging negatively or positively those capsules; which eats battery life.",1 year ago,"Meaning --- the time (and hopefully the date) on the lock screen can be shown literally ALL day; instead of being timed out; without negatively effecting daily battery consumption! THIS IS A HUGE DEAL. For anyone whom likes the ""glance"" feature with windows phones or any OS that displays the time during lockout --- we proud light phone 2 users CAN have our cake and eat it too!!!"
I have upgraded to a dumb phone a few months ago; and the only thing I'm really missing is calendar functionality. I've been using Google Calender quite heavily for as long as I can remember; and that would be a really convenient - though not distracting - feature. Is there any information about the technical possibility of this; as well as the likelihood that calendar functionality might make it into the LP2 software?,1 year ago,"Hi Kevin; That's really great feedback thanks for sharing. Technically I see less challenges with a calendar functionality; although we would most likely need to make our of calendar that could accept Google; Apple; and other calendar inputs rather than having it be ""Google Calendar"" as you know it on web. My biggest concern was around the size of the screen of the Light Phone being quite small; but that could be solved perhaps with good design of the interface. Hope all is well!

Hey Joe! Exactly; I was thinking of some sort of ""Light Phone Calendar"" that could be linked to Google/Apple/Whatever Calendar. About the size of the screen; creative juices will have to get flowing for a working interface indeed. However; even the flip phone I'm using now has it's own (not-linked; obviously) calendar-program; so I think it could work.Keep up the good work; looking forward to any future updates!"
It's a wonderful looking product. Obviously adding features is a balancing act that needs to be carefully managed. Here in UK/Europe; every restaurant/cafe/public transportation payment point accepts contactless payments. Having a wallet system would be wonderful/not distracting; but I suspect it probably requires NFC.,1 year ago,I agree that it would not come as a distraction and yes I believe it would require NFC which currently the phone does not have. I think our bigger concerns were around our lack of expertise in payment handling which needs to be incredibly secure. There are perhaps existing players we could work with; but we didn't think payments were a huge priority honestly; but again this is why we are so happy to get feedback from our future users.
The displayed time on the lock screen should have the date as well.-Maybe just add a Calendar?,1 year ago,
"-contacts (calls)-text (messages)-alarm (multi-day set up)-audio (be able to DL playlists and display track per track)-camera (if you didn't take a pic - did it really happen haha... really though it's needed )-directions (turn by turn in advance distance via gps)-haptic sensor (on/off via physical ""double tap"" anywhere on device)-NFC chip instead of usbC (wireless charging and pair to BT with a physical ""single tap"")*However a tool to beckon uber is not on my list of needs at all*",1 year ago,
I read about 'chat' over the weekend; where mobile providers (pushed by Google) are going to support sending messages via rich communication services (RCS) rather than SMS. This will make it possible to set up group messages and imbed QR codes. Is this something you can/are planning on supporting?,1 year ago,Hi Chris; We were also reading about 'chat' this weekend. We're definitely going to be following this as well. If this becomes a universal carrier messaging means it seems logical that we would support it for sure; but at this time I do not know enough about how carriers will integrate this. Thanks for sharing this though!

I think having a duplicate SIM is illegal in the US. The laws might have been written to prevent fraud. My plan is to get a sim with pay as you go plan.,1 year ago,
Use twin SIMSIf your telecoms supplier provides this option; ask them to duplicate your existing SIM so you can make and receive calls to your smartphone number when its time for Reachability Lite.,1 year ago,"*DID NOT mean to put the word ""Reachabilty"" in there haha

Twin SIMs (also sometimes called duplicate or cloned SIMs) are pretty much the perfect way to use the Light Phone if supported by your carrier/region. From what I've learned from our backers of the last phone I believe it is only legal in some countries; however many carriers plan to offer a ""Twin SIM"" experience; like TMobile Digits for example; that would simulate the ability to have two SIMs with the same number; something only they are capable of pulling off. Thanks for sharing this Ian!"
Over the weekend I went to a nature reserve with my parents; beautiful place and weather. There was a mother and daughter taking photos of the wild life around them; as I looked across I noticed her son sitting there engrossed in his smartphone; not in the least bothered about where he was; this instilled in me why I decided to order the Light phone; because just over a year ago I would have been like him; and I'm so happy that the Light phone team happened; I can't wait to see what you do next!,1 year ago,Thanks for sharing that story Max. I've definitely been in public before and found myself almost depressed at how few people were not staring at their phones while at the park on a beautiful day. We're all vulnerable; that's for sure. I also can't wait to see what the future holds! Cheers
Thanks Joe and the team for making this possible. I am super excited and looking forward to be a partnof this awesome journey into the LIGHT!?,1 year ago,:)
Dwa pytanka:- aktualizacje systemowe ?- aplikacja do notatki; samo wpisywanie tekstu; bez synchronizacji; bez podziau na notatki; jak sticy note tyle e tylko 1 ?,1 year ago,
Amazing!! Stretch goal achieved.. But any updates?,1 year ago,Sorry for the late update; wanted to wait until the weekend was over to email everyone... but wow are we excited!!
Campaign's over...no update?,1 year ago,Just posted! We are going to try our best to keep our mass emails/updates to happening during the week as much as possible.
Thinking long term; do you plan on making more phones in the future? If not then how long would this one be in production?,1 year ago,Hmm too early to say; we are pretty focused on getting this phone right and currently have no plans for a future phone.
Is the phone going to have multiple keyboard support? Heres wishing for .,1 year ago,Hope so too; and it seems likely possible to do so; but we have not fully flushed out the keyboard yet; thanks for understanding.
Whether to support TD-LTE or FDD-LTE network standard,1 year ago,To the best of my understanding I believe it supports both standards; but I will need to verify that with our engineers. Thanks for understanding!
Congrats on the successful campaign guys!!!Really looking forward to the survey for user involvement too!I think there is many people (myself included) that have some potentially great ideas / input!For example (it's a bit out there): if you were to include a basic camera module.. in combination with the e-ink display... could potentially result in some nice 'retro look' black & white images?! Or is that already too 'heavy'? :),1 year ago,"Hey! Thanks for the support! I actually think that sounds super fun and not necessarily ""too heavy""; but we really don't think that we can fit such a  module into the tiny already packed form factor and from development standpoint we are not sure we could support the additional work of image processing; at least to the caliber of quality we'd expect at this stage. Thanks for understanding!

Thanks for your reply!Maybe something to keep in mind for verison 3? ;)In any case; looking forward to the survey.. many more ideas in store !Cheers and success!"
Congrats on the ultra-successful campaign with over 600 percent of the initial funding goal! It just goes to show that in today's increasingly social media dominated culture; there are still many people who desire to reign in the technology & take back control.May your design iteration process be just as smooth & rewarding. I'm sure you have a wealth of suggestions on improvements & ideas for features.As for features; being able to hide them from the main menu via settings would be welcomed.,1 year ago,Hey!! Yes; it is truly incredible for us to have reached so many people with our campaign. We feel completely rejuvenated and eager to get everything rolling full speed development. As for hiding unwanted features; we actually consider this a must as we really want to keep the phone as Light as possible for users that are not looking for any additional features; and so far in our explorations this should be totally possible.
"Communication with a focus on utility is important; so calls/text/email for identity verification (with custom UI) is a must. A calculator & alarm would streamline things as you wouldn't need a physical alarm clock - but anything else (such as supporting Spotify); weather; maps/directions; & camera are trivial at best & disruptive at worst (would be as privacy-invading as it'd be pointless as cheaper smartphones have better cameras); & in my opinion would go against the ""going light"" philosophy.",1 year ago,"I think that is a good way to articulate it. At the end of the day; it is about simple communication and utility. I tend to agree about many of the additional features as well and I hope we can find a balance where there is enough potential functionality to suite the variety  of users we have and to allow them the peace of mind to comfortably leave their smartphones without comprising the 'going light' philosophy. I would also love to challenge anyone who thinks they NEED a feature to try...

An afternoon without said feature. Time and time again with the original Light Phone; the lack of that feature one thought they maybe needed; ended up being the empowering aspect of the experience.  I can at least assure you that your phone can always be as precisely minimal and light as your prefer without ever having unwanted features on your device. Thanks again for the support and encouragement!"
Stretch goalgood job,1 year ago,Yep!! :)
Can anyone tell me if you can just pop the SIM card out of your phone and pop it into this one? If you go away for the weekend; for example. It works for the Punkt phones so I hope it will work here.,1 year ago,Hi Sarah; Assuming that your carrier's network is compatible with the Light Phone that shouldn't be a problem at all!
Stretch!,1 year ago,yeah!!
Woo Hoo!! Stretch goal!!,1 year ago,:)
Congrats on reaching the stretch goal! Looking forward to seeing people's input on the forums!,1 year ago,Likewise and thanks! The forum is pretty much ready to go; we just want to test a few more things (it's my first time making something like that) before launching it to everyone. The invites to make your account will come in an email this week or the following. CHeers!
Great phone! I love the aesthetics and simplicity a lot!One thing that came to my mind was another possibility for user interaction. Make the display responsive to touch and force. Having limited space for buttons would make a harder touch on something on the screen a really good option to show some more information. Volume adjustment could also be done by applying force to the farthest right or left edge of the screen on two points or to drag like one is scrolling in a list.,1 year ago,Hey Alexander! That's a pretty cool concept I have to say. I see how it can be useful for sure. I'm not familiar with such force touch tech myself and I believe we may be relatively committed to the E-Ink module that we've already customized if we want to make sure we keep to our timeline; but I do really appreciate you sharing that with us! Hope that all is well and can't wait to get you your Light Phone II!
Yay!  Congratulations on reaching your stretch goal; and with not a moment to spare  :),1 year ago,Yeah; really down to the last day huh!
Stretch goal accomplished!!!Bluetooth !!!,1 year ago,Yep!! :)
Definately would like to see a music player- ideally Spotify or micro sd card; maps; and bluetooth now the stretch goal was hit! A small camera would be very useful also.,1 year ago,
I think we made the stretch goal already. How about the case for lightphone that you said can be fuction as beautiful lock; Will you make it as an adds on?,1 year ago,I do really want to make a case; I guess we were hesitant to offer it prematurely and want to finish the final mechanical design work before exploring the case. It's a great idea though; and we hope to have a few options available with the initial shipping of the phone. Thanks!
Made it to the stretch goal ?,1 year ago,"* Meant to type a smiley face emoji but it came up as a question mark

Haha thanks David!!"
I'm not sure if I just missed it; but is it possible to select which region phone you receive? I would consider getting a different region to where I currently live to use as travel phone. Really excited and am glad that the Bluetooth stretch goal is almost reached. My main requests are maps/directions as I am constantly getting lost and some sort of way to access music and/or audiobooks.,1 year ago,"Hi Thomas; To eliminate confusion; we took the ""pick your model"" choice off of the pledge and figured it'd make more sense to explain the differences and let users pick/change through out the development process. A long way to say; you can pick any model/region you'd like. Sorry for not making that more clear!

No worries Joe. Thanks for the explanation!"
Dang; it's 10:35 and Perfect Pizzas closed at 9.  ? ,1 year ago,lol!
An idea I had for what one of the screens may look like in the Navigation tool: https://drive.google.com/open?id=186cxO_Jy3nzpEgz4baFpiSc95sJsuFok,1 year ago,Oh yeah! This is awesome! Definitely seems fitting and stripped to it's essential information. Love this kind of brainstorming.
"This is a 4G phone...There are plenty of ""mini-phones"" or ""basic"" or credit card form factor phones that are the market now that only make calls; and the great news is that they are all under $100.The LPv2 is going to utilize 4G service for a reason...Simplicity is a word that is thrown around a lot these days; but can you really replace your smartphone 60% of the time with a phone that doesn't have the ability to text?I do NOT want a mini-smartphone; but a real solution to live LIGHTER.",1 year ago,
It is pleasing that many functions will be added; especially the CONTACTS function will be enhanced. However; I'd like the Light Phone to keep simple.If possible; it is desirable that all functions except PHONE can be disabled from the setting screen.I want to separate SIM for data communication and SIM for call. Therefore; we want to invalidate only the function involving data communication.good luck.,1 year ago,Hello and thank you for the support! We will definitely allow the use plenty of control to limit the phone to be as minimal as they'd like. We love your concern about staying truly simple and think you'll be really excited by the phone we deliver next year. Appreciate it!
The Light brand is evolving; please embrace this change.No one can truly move forward to the new day whom still holds onto yesterday. We are here supporting a tech disrupting device; collectively inputting wants/needs.The new LPv2 is not a secondary device as it cannot share your primary number...Therefore; we will need this device to do MORE; simply of course; but with purpose.,1 year ago,
Please stay true to the Light brand. Keep it simple with useful tools.,1 year ago,"For sure; David! Thank you for keeping this 'light' voice high in the comments. It's true that this is not a mini-smartphone; but a different kind of phone focused on utility and simplicity. I will add that any additional ""tools"" that may be offered in time will always be completely optional and one can keep the phone as minimal as they would like. Hope that makes sense and thanks again for the support! Cheers"
"E-ink screens are frowned upon because most think they are basic...-This is not the case at all; they can show great definition in grey scale.-The clarity in direct sunlight is simply superb!-With this tech the LPv2 can ""show"" us much more than the promo video teaser hints-Open this platform to a camera tool as you can see what your taking a pic of; also it can display weather forecasts; as well as a playlist for audio; ect ect; point being that we have vast options; we are NOT limited!",1 year ago,
"Please check out ""YOTAPHONE"".They have been using the e-ink screen technology for three generations of phones now...Could help figure out back-lighting and any other shortcuts to aid with the LPv2 build?It's used for a dual screen; putting secondary info on the back; while you work on front screen.",1 year ago,
For me; this would be perfect if it did just 5 things:1. Phone calls (obvs ?)2. Messages - but integration with WhatsApp would be a big win3. A music player (preferably Spotify integration)4. Bluetooth - mostly for music but hands free calling is very useful5. Directions/mapping - because of we spend less time playing with our device and more time exploring; it's good to find your way back to somewhere (like home or a hotel)I really can't wait to get my Light Phone 2!,1 year ago,Hi Graham;Thanks for sharing this feedback and for supporting our project. Also really can't wait to get you your Light Phone 2! These features are definitely aligned with our most common feedback so far; so assuming all is feasible I can't see why we wouldn't make those tools an option for our users. Cheers!
Backed! One biggie for me is dual SIM (I live and work in two different countries); but I suspect that space constraints could make this feature difficult.,1 year ago,"Bluetooth would also be great for using wireless headsets and the like!

Our concerns will dual SIM having everything to do with space constraints; although I can totally see your reasoning for wanting that; unfortunately I don't think it will be possible. It's really quite a small phone! Bluetooth however is something we plan to include. Thanks for the support!"
If thinking about sealing the case for waterproofing...How about deleting the usbC.?And instead adding an NFC chip!Since we will not need to charge often - no need for a fast usbC port.,1 year ago,
"Home Screen Tools:+Call(Contacts)+Messaging (Text)+Media (Music)+Camera (20+mp)+Directions (TurnByTurn)+Alarm (Multi-Day)+Weather (basic Mon-Sun)+To-Do List (Notes)***When showing the TIME on the lock-out screen please include DATE*** ---> Why not free up space on the device by getting rid of the physical lock/unlock button and instead run a haptic-feedback sensor where we can simply double tap the device to ""wake"" and ""sleep""?",1 year ago,
Maybe this has been asked (unable to search through previous questions) but what about kindle? I've been wishing someone would make a e-ink cell phone for a while. I know you're designing to be used as little as possible; but I reading must be a healthy exception to that rule. Ya?,1 year ago,No worries! We are working on a forum/message board for after the campaign which will hopefully simplify the collective brainstorming we have going on :) While I don't disagree that reading is something positive; one initial concern is that the screen size is pretty small and might not be great for lots of text; but it's definitely a possibility we will explore. I guess as a graphic designer I'm still a paper book kind of guy myself; but I do see where you're coming from! Cheers

"In addition to the message from Kenneth Schlatter about more side buttons and mine previously about an oldschool jog dial; maybe a better use of space and less prone to hardware failure; is a tiny side touch strip such as used in TicWatches (search this IGG page for ""tickle"": https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ticpods-free-most-interactive-wireless-earbuds-bluetooth-design/x/2414151 )",1 year ago,"Interesting; I've never really seen something just like that. Have you had any personal experience? It's definitely space saving! My initial concern is around unintentionally swiping being an issue; but I'm sure that's maybe been considered? Thanks for sharing!

Sadly I haven't; but it seems like it might be a clever compromise to having moving parts. I guess you'd lose the ability to change the volume while the handset is locked; to avoid unintentional swipes; but maybe after you've unlocked everything would be ok? Unless you unlocked while touching the slider in which case maybe ignore it until you let go? Feels like something to iterate on and see what works best with a real-ish device."
I wish there was a way to search comments; as this topic might have already been discussed. But I am curious as to the network configuration of the phone. I'm a US citizen living abroad with my family for the foreseeable future. Will this phone be GSM or CDMA? What MHZ bands will it operate within? I'm already bought in because I love the concept; but it would be even better if I could use the product! Haha,1 year ago,"Hi Adam; Thanks for the support! Will try my best to asnwer your quesiton; but I can also refer to our engineers if I'm not being specific enough. The Light Phone II is currently spec'd to hold 5 bands; so we're planning three models to optimize for the  largest networks around the world. The bands for each model can be found here: thelightphone.com/4gcoverage ; in the US (model A) that is bands: 2; 4; 12; 13; 17. I hope that was able to answer you question!

Solid; thanks Joe!"
Here's a question; is it possible for some form of relationship between a users primary (light phone 2) and secondary (smartphone) whereby a notification could be sent to individuals attempting to contact the user's smartphone which would direct  them to contact the user's light phone # (like an away message on AIM) - assuming the user has both primary and secondary phones with the same service provider?,1 year ago,"I got caught up reading Ian's post - verizon is my service provider as well.

Yep! We wrote about away message hacking on our blog: https://medium.com/the-light-phone/setting-up-an-away-message-fd3efd856f0b . iOS is a little bit of a hack; but it would not require the phones to have the same provider. Call forwarding to the Light Phone (assuming urgent situations will be handled through phone calls) is completely possible; so a caller can still get a hold of you and if someone texts they can either wait for you to return to smartphone or text the new light number.

Also; from our international user experience; some users told us they simply gave their new light phone number to their speed dials (the people you might be contacting while light) and so even though it couldn't keep the outgoing phone number; it was still recognized as them. They set up call forwarding the same way; so there was no confusion as to what number others would call them at. Hope that makes sense and thanks for the input!"
It would be pretty awesome if there was a built-in anti glare screen. Excited for the Light Phone 2.,1 year ago,"NO EMAIL; No Social Media of any kind - stay true to the organization's founding principals. Waterproof; talk; and text sound good to me & I wouldn't mind some kind of navigation & ride-sharing application.Getting into negative territory regarding music and weather.

Fortunately the matte E-Ink screen is naturally anti-glare... I found this image that demonstrates it online: http://54.147.59.70/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/E-Ink-VS-LCD-screen.jpg . Cheers!"
Instead of two buttons for navigation; how about four? it could be set up like the Pebble smartwatch: up; down; and select on one side with a back button on the other side. They wouldn't be used for advanced input like typing or dialing; but it would be great for simple UI navigation.,1 year ago,Thats an interesting thought! I've never used a Pebble in person; but will have to investigate how they did it further. Kaiwei and I will definitely be exploring button options; I know space within the device is incredibly scarce and that might be a factor. Thanks for sharing that idea though!
"Howdy all. Really looking forward to this device; as I'm trying to make a conscious effort to reduce my dependence on being ""hyper-connected"". That said; there are some convenience features that I'm interested in; specifically around information management between the device and *basic* cloud services.Will this device be able to sync contacts with general LDAP/CardDAV accounts?",1 year ago,We haven't determined the the exact details of contact syncing; but we do plan to ask all of our backers how they currently store their contacts/prefer to sync so we can hopefully accommodate everyone's needs within our capabilities. Thanks for the support; super excited as well!
Will I be able to use this as secondary device; like I have been doing with my LPv1?>I do not want to have to buy a new contract; or add a phone; and thus a different phone line...Verizon is my mobile device service provider; will the LPv2 only be able to use GSM?North West Colorado has very few GSM towers...I beta tested a Nokia 950XL and HP Elite X3 last year; requiring a GSM plan; in that two months of usage I could not make a call or even receive a call at my downtown residential home!,1 year ago,"Unlike the first Light Phone you will not be able to keep your same phone number as your smartphone for outgoing messages/calls because it is not possible with most carriers to do so (a few are introducing programs which may be ready by the time we ship; alleviating that issue). All Light Phones require a SIM; whether that's one of our SIMs or through your existing provider. The Light Phone II will use 4G LTE bands: 2; 4; 12; 13; 17. Hope that is helpful!

This news is a deal breaker for me. I wish that fact had been expressed in a more transparent fashion... I like the fact that I can use my LPv1 with my phone/number. This is a secondary device; not a replacement. To go ""light"" meant something substantial when your first 10;000 LPv1's came out. However now with the LPv2 going ""light"" means to spend more and get less? A 4GLTE plan isn't cheap; nor is this new model phone... Can my $260 be refunded due to this ""hidden"" fact?

You can of course refund your pledge; we really didn't mean to make it feel ""hidden"" at all. I'm sorry for the disappointment; it's just without having a universal solution to keeping one's phone number with messages (which we will continue to explore) we can't promise that feature as much as we wish we could. We still plan to support the original Light Phone and continue to produce them for users that want that functionality. Please let me know if you need help with the refund.

*For anyone else; whom may be reading this thread:Upon finding this unfortunate fact and confirming it now with Joe...I just got off the phone with Verizon; a ""basic"" plan of 4GLTE service is $30/monthly if you choose to prepay/preload for each month of usage; or just shy of $450 when signing a 1yr contract.

Carriers might not offer a very affordable 4G plan perhaps; but if you are adding an additional line to an existing smartphone plan it might not be so much? Light will also be offering a few options for plans (primary and secondary users in mind) but we do not have those details finalized yet. This is the reality of cellphones that they will require service though. Switching your other SIM into the Light Phone although annoying to always do would maintain the phone number without needing a plan.

The point of this device for me is to simplify my out-of-office time; which basically boils down to only 24 hours a week. I like the LPv1 because I can leave my windows phone at my office and enjoy being un-tethered. In dire need a client can still call me on my actual phone number. Without having that option on the LPv2; and thus now having to maintain 2 phone numbers will not only be confusing for my clients; but a hindrance...making more stress; which goes against the theory of ""going light"".

The pivotal point I am trying to make is: what made the LPv1 so useful was the ease of usage. Why when making a new version (which should improve upon what made that old version so good) did you decide to not focus on what sold all 10;000 of those phones. If you had done this to begin with; we would not have made it to this point in time. The project would have not taken off the ground if everyone had to have two phone numbers. Does anyone have ANY solution to this integral problem?

I am not disagreeing! Our goal was ""a seamless second phone"" which keeping the same number seemed critical. I will just add a few points just for context. We had almost 40% of users as international users who were not able to use that number masking functionality and in my user feedback it actually turns out it was less of a hurdle than we initially imagined. Secondly it was never our area of expertise and we spent lots of time and resources trying to solve it; which caused us to ship late...

Joe; please take a nano-sim from a Verizon Phone and insert it into your prototype LPv2. Try to complete a call; then try to receive a call. Next try to send a text; then try to receive a text. If all four scenarios work without problems; then I will gladly keep my money in this project. I am a FIRM believer of your function/form hardware; worldwide collective determined OS; and tech disrupting concept. Thus I want nothing more than for the Light Phone 2 to work for everyone. Let me know please?

We decided to instead shift our focus to prioritizing the device itself; perfecting the hardware and software of the phone to be the best it can be; and allowing our users the option to fit it into their lifestyle as they chose; be it a second phone or their primary phone. Check out Verizon Number Share - https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/numbershare-faqs/ -  carriers are capable of solving this in ways we could never; I really hope this makes sense!

Call forwarding to the Light Phone II is still completely possible and encouraged for the situation you mention above. What is not possible is us to send a message from the Light Phone II as if it came from your primary phone number; again; I know this stuff can be confusing and I hope it all makes sense; happy to clarify further!

That makes a lot of sense and is a great idea; but I unfortunately will not be able to perform that test prior to the end of the campaign; and understand you may chose to get a refund. I'd be happy to extend the offer for the discounted price for being a loyal supporter since V1. Thanks for understanding! I really do appreciate your continued support and passion for what we're working on. I also second that thought exactly; ""I want nothing more than for the Light Phone 2 to work for everyone."""
"My main concern is the White color model:>With the black ink text contrast on a matte white ""screen/face"" how will you be able to read when their is no sunlight or ambient light source to see the black font; i.e. night time?If this ""screen/face"" is not black-lit... then won't this make the white model blank at night???I ordered white for the opposite reason: that the black ink text on white matte - would be very easy to read in direct sunlight. An issue with my current WQHD AMOLED display.",1 year ago,"Hi Ian;We plan to make sure both models are visible in both daylight/nightlight. The E-ink screen is by far the most legible screen in direct sun because it is matte. Both models will have lighting so that they are visible in darkness too. We consider visibility an essential aspect to the phone . Thanks!

""We consider visibility an essential aspect to the phone.""  Yes; I agree the LPv1 is near-impossible to read the screen in direct lighting conditions. How will the new lighting be implemented; i.e. what tech will be used to achieve this? Just wondering; as what you decide upon will directly effect daily battery life; and the device's longevity being that the battery is non-replaceable?

I believe it's called ""side lighting"" and it's something we are working with E-ink on; but I do not know the exact technical details or power consumption specifications right now sorry. Ideally users won't be spending long periods of time on the phone as it is the opposite of our goal so hopefully the drain in battery life will be minor from the light. Visibility was something we wanted to address with the Light Phone II as it was an issue in daylight with our original phone. Thanks!"

Waterproofing a phone of this size could be accommodated via a zip lock bag (or a custom accessory of some sort; given to early backers at no added cost). I'd prefer owner seviceability or just small size to waterproofing IF it is a trade.,1 year ago,It's true; there is a lot of potential for cases because the form factor of the phone is so small as it is.
List of hopes for light 2-Calling and texting-contacts-maps-notesDream for light 2SPOTIFY ?,1 year ago,
What a great idea...just put in an order. Please please please make it waterproof! This could be a great workout companion/mp3 player as long as its not too delicate. oh and of course... ride hailing; mobile payment; weather. Really excited about this. Cheers!,1 year ago,
For mobile payment solution .... Google Pay would be out as the phone most likely won't have Google Service. How about Samsung Pay? I heard Samsung have been pushing for including their payment system in third party phone? Although I am not too sure about how Samsung Pay handle things like privacy and connectivity and data security,1 year ago,
This is fantastic... the only feature that I'd like to see before I can buy into it fully is some sort of payments system. I'd love to be able to pay with Venmo or an Apple Pay-like app; since these are often far more secure than credit cards,1 year ago,Interesting; I would not have thought myself that payments system would be such a priority; I guess I'm old school and still like cash best. It's not something we are experts in ourselves; and the high sensitivity to security of handling payments is a little intimidating without much further explorations to be totally honest. But it's great that we are able to learn from our backers; thanks for sharing this!
Hey Joe; I am super excited about this phone. But I'm just wondering about its production? Where do you plan on it being manufactured; and will you support fair trade?Thanks! I am pumped for the release of this new gadget.PS. A notetaking section possibly? Something that could just store text files?,1 year ago,We are not sure of the exact manufacturing location yet (our partner has a variety of facilities and that decision will be made closer to mass production typically). Our previous phone was produced in Yantai; China - here's a little blog post about that production https://medium.com/the-light-phone/coming-soon-d9ee2327ea4b .  I wish we could make a fair trade phone (Fair Phone is an inspiration!) At our scale we dont have the ability to transform the industry in ways that it actually needs.
I share B C's concern about serviceability. It all boils down to: Using components (especially battery) that are available for individual purchase. Engineering the phone so it can be dis- and re-assembled without breaking. Maybe ask the iFixit team for some pointers on glue; screws and logic board connectors; especially if you're going for waterproofing.,1 year ago,
How will battery replacement work? Lithium batteries have limited number of cycles at 100%; after which they slowly degrade.Is the Light Phone 2 a one-time thing (where you have to buy a new one when the battery goes below 75%; which isn't good for the environment); or will it be possible to replace it manually or get it serviced?,1 year ago,"It's an unfortunate reality of many of our electronics. It's not my area of expertise personally at Light; but I know it's not an easy challenge to have it manually serviceable. We have been able to service them for the first Light Phone; but that process was still not so efficient. I hope that we can find a suitable solution that doesn't compromise the product itself and allows the phone to have the longest possible life span. Thanks for keeping sustainability a part of the conversation!

Thanks for the answer. Having user-removable batteries will definitely make the phone thicker (due to additional moving parts/battery covers) and reduce the simplicity; but perhaps an international servicing option (Send in the Light Phone by international mail; battery service offered at cost; and return by mail at cost) would be great.

That's a great suggestion; and I would be very open to exploring such an idea. Cheers!"
OpenStreetMap.org may seem suitable for providing navigation. Appears it also stores basic information about stores; restaurants etc. such as phone numbers and opening hours which may be useful information to display when showing directions.,1 year ago,Yep; that's on our list to explore! Thanks for pointing it out.
Just a thought - it would be nice to have a world clock to check what time it is in other countries. Although you can easily work it out; daylight savings time does complicate matters sometimes.,1 year ago,Noted!
Joe! Im excited to be a backer of the Light Phone. I wanted to ask if the function of a calculator has been considered yes for final release. I am diabetic and having a calculator handy to dial in my insulin for meals is crucial. If there is a way to convince you to add that function to the phone it would be a godsend and a big reason I could leave my smartphone behind!,1 year ago,Noted! It's definitely something we think is aligned and at a high level it seems relatively simple to execute. Thank you for sharing your concerns around this and explaining why it is so important; I really do think and hope we can include the calculator.
I hope the display area is large to make it look more modern.,1 year ago,
Hi Joe; you should try discourse.org. Many of my favourite forums use it; and its design fits much better with your philosophy than that of TapTalk; Slack; Discord; or any of the other popular platforms. You'll have to host it yourself; but from what I've heard; setting it up is painless if you have basic web dev experience.,1 year ago,Whoa; this is what I was hoping existed... thanks a ton for the suggestion; going to try to set it up today/this weekend!
Hi Joe;Great idea and TapTalk might be the best so far; we can also try having a channel on discord. Announcements and different topics for discussions can be added there as well. Havent used TapTalk at all; so cant say anything but would consider Discord channel.,1 year ago,
Hello Backers;I've been exploring a variety of message board/forum platforms to engage the community in more meaningful ways after the campaign closes. I've never created my own before and was hoping some of you might have suggestions for what might work best. Ideally we'd want it to be exclusive to the backers; ability to pay for no advertising/branding; and a relatively customizable/clean design. Currently looking at TapTalk. Any tips/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!,1 year ago,
Please make it dual sim as well it will be great to have unlimited contacts storage or cloud storage. The main problem inam facing with simple phone is typing a message it will be nice if swipe feature is added.It should be a smart phone without social media.,1 year ago,
Please make it dual sim,1 year ago,
I love the idea of a simple phone; with minimal features.  To continue the theme of reducing stress; It would be great if the phone had a basic music/mp3 player to be able to play guided meditations.  It would also be great if it could record simple audio notes for recording ideas without having to type them out on a small keypad (which is itself stressful!).  Well done and I cant wait to ditch my fully functional and constantly nagging smartphone in favor of the Light Phone 2!,1 year ago,
Keep the phone simple and limited to the promised basic functions. Why not integrate a simple interpreter that would allow anyone; to write their own apps using JavaScript?,1 year ago,Definitely a possibility; thanks for pointing that out. Cheers
Hey Joe!I was wondering why y'all are planning to put up/down buttons on the right side. Isn't the phone touch screen? #lessismore #light-JP//I mean I wouldn't mind them.. It gives a retro feel to the device//like a tbt to phones from the 90s which were oh so simple,1 year ago,The exact user experience is subject to further testing; perhaps everything will end up being touch based; but our initial hunch was that the physical buttons would be a nice and simple way to easily navigate the phone. The phone is touch screen; but we are also aware that the E-Ink screen may not perform in the same ways as a more common OLED display with motion nuances of touch.  The buttons will also control call volume while on a call which is something our original Light Phone lacked too.
"While some of these are ""heavy"" they are usually the kind of apps that are controlled easily. They don't vie for your attention; you go to them if you need or want them.",1 year ago,Hi Steven; Thanks for sharing these ideas. While I can see how they may be easily controlled; our larger concerns around over promising features has to do with  our engineering and development resources as well as the small screen and battery of the Light Phone 2.  I hope that makes sense and cannot wait to share the Light Phone 2 with you!
- Kindle app for reading would be really nice! I know you want to stay light; but there are times; such as waiting in an office; when catching up on a Kindle book is helpful- I use MiCal for iPhone and would love to be able to access that or an iOS calendar app- Depending on the hard drive space; Voxer could come in handy; as well as a voice memo app- Podcast app possible?- Sync with ToDo Cloud?- Evernote- Pocket for article reading,1 year ago,
I would like to see:- Google Maps- Texting- Camera (this could be distracting but could be used for a special moment or license plate or car pictures in an accident as others mentioned)- Olive Tree Bible app would be nice; but I know that's a long shot depending on contracts with developers,1 year ago,
It seems you don't need a partnership to make an Uber app: https://developer.uber.com/docs/riders/ride-requests/tutorials/api/introductionIn a couple of places (the initial auth and getting the user to confirm surge pricing afaics) the app needs to display a WebView to Uber's site; so those may not look Light-y; but the rest of the experience could be.,1 year ago,Thanks for sharing this; I believe this is what our software team was referencing when we did our initial research into the possibility. Cheers!
Hi Joe. Really excited to have this phone; next year. For months; I had this idea and was thinking if only there was a phone that is minimal but also helped me with navigation and Uber and than I saw this. I think this product has a great future but please do not miss maps and Uber; else I could just buy a Nokia 1100( yes style is just a distant requirement),1 year ago,Hello! Also can't wait until next year; glad our paths crossed. I think maps and Uber (or other ridesharing) were the two most common feature ideas from our existing backer polls. Uber although an awesome idea; will require some sort of partnership and customization; and we will do everything we can to try our best to pull it off in the most 'light' possible way. Thanks for understanding!
Hello; will there be any tools for 3rd party developers to create software for the Lite Phone 2? I appreciate you're probably not looking to create a AppStore-like environment; however it'd be great to be able to make custom software for our individual devices.,1 year ago,"Hi Rob; That's a great point; and one we initially had not considered but we do think it makes sense; especially how you are describing it for one's individual device. We do not yet know how this will pan out in terms of interface; but it's something we are accounting for in how we architect the OS already to leave the possibility open. Hope that makes sense! (also we will most likely be using the React Native framework if that is helpful) Thanks again for the support

Hi Joe; Thats good to hear! I know React well. Would love to start tinkering with a development sandbox when one becomes available!"
How about another month so the Bluetooth stretch goal can be made ?,1 year ago,I think Indiegogo only allows one extension unfortunately; but there are still 12 days left so hopefully we can still get there!
Hi; it would be nice to be able to disable data so that this is truly a dumb phone that only talks and texts. I am looking to get rid of my smart phone and replace it and the accompanying data plan with a dumb phone but still have the ease of screen texting instead of t9 etc.,1 year ago,"Hi Tim; Functionality wise totally possible to keep it to just calls and texts. You should be able to use any voice/text plan with a compatible carrier.  Also I'd like to add that we do plan to offer a few plans directly through Light. Because of the phone's limited functionality; there is an opportunity to offer a really competitive unlimited plan for just calls and texts through a streamlined Light interface. In the coming months we will share those details if you are interested. Cheers!

Thanks for the reply Joe. Thats exactly what i am looking for and even cooler to be able to get the plan via light as well."
Thank you for creating this. I hope you stick to the true minimal features and if you do add more; let there be options to hide them for people who don't want to be distracted by it! I don't think playlists is a necessity but like others have said; I plan to completely replace my smartphone so navigation will definitely be needed.A question: Although saving the photos will not be an option; will we be able to receive and view photos over text?Thank you guys!,1 year ago,"Also; if there are any troubles with the phone; will customer/technician support and/or warranty be provided to any degree?

Hello! Thanks for the support. We definitely agree about minimal features; and any additional features would be completely optional and hidden from one's device (we hope to have some mock ups soon of how that might work). Currently there are no plans to support photos; but we could explore work arounds if that is something we see a huge demand for from our backers. We don't have a finalized warranty yet but we will look after our original backers for sure! Support is handled directly with Light."
Also; very interested in tracking this project developing; and would be happy to lend any expertise to development of the UI or 3rd party apps/framework if it's on top of AOSP with React Native as previously mentioned; and if it's either being developed in the open or in a repo that we can agree to some NDA and help with as IGG backers? I imagine a percentage of the people here are mobile devs and would be happy to help or at least talk over plans if there were a repo/forum/slack/whatever.,1 year ago,Hey Stephen! This is a super interesting idea. I would need to verify the exact specifics with the software team (not super technical myself) but the idea of having support from IGG backers makes sense. It's definitely what got our interest in allowing users to customize their devices if they were familiar with mobile dev. We do plan to find a general forum for the community; we've been exploring a bunch of options and maybe there can be a more specific channel like Slack for developers? Thanks!
"If you're using the ""volume"" buttons for up and down on the interface; have you considered using a hardware jog dial / scroll wheel type thing (as per some old nokia and sony ericssons); that way you get up/down and also a click in for select?",1 year ago,I kind of love that suggestion and would personally love to explore those options. We made a few plastic prototypes with different sized buttons and it's something that we still need to perfect. I believe the hesitation for the wheel  was initially around the mechanical structure effects (there isn't a lot of room inside the phone); but it's not off the table! Thanks for pointing that out. Ability to click in and select is a nice gesture in my opinion.
When the mobile phone comes to China; can I choose the express way in China? For example; China post or sf-express.,1 year ago,
Hoping that you reach your stretch goal of including Bluetooth. Bluetooth will give users options to use this phone as a Bluetooth tether to their smartphone similar to the Kase phone where the user can use their light phone as a Bluetooth receiver and text messaging interface while their smartphone is hidden in the users bag or pocket. This will also give the option of using the light phone without the need of a sim chip.,1 year ago,We do too! We will try our best to include Bluetooth regardless of the stretch goal...
"Idea for notes: Instead of a notes tool; you could send yourself a text message but it could be stored locally on the phone rather than being sent through the phone network and being charged for it. This way because it is a text; you will be discouraged from writing a long message to your future self. Would be good if you could set a time to be reminded about a note though - for example you could have a note as a txt message with ""Buy Bread"" and get a subtle reminder at 7am.",1 year ago,A lot of interesting ideas there David; thanks for sharing. The reminder function could be really helpful I'm sure; I was never quite able to make a habit of it myself on a smartphone but maybe I should play with it some more for ideas. Another idea discussed in an earlier comment was to make the notes more like voice memos because of the limited screen size. This is going to be really fun to work on; super exciting.
I've been using a feature phone for a while and the only things I feel like you really need other than call/text/alarm are Maps & Uber (both just because sometimes you get in a real pickle). That might be even better if you could do it using Offline Areas as someone else suggested,1 year ago,"...(hit post too soon!) being able to take notes is a nice feature but you can just use a notebook. Having a hotspot is nice; but I feel like that's just a window to doing all the distracting things you'd do on your smartphone on some other device instead. Weather you can check before you leave the house. Music would be nice to have but I can't imagine it not draining the battery of such a tiny phone in barely any time at all...

Thanks for sharing your experiences with actually using a flip phone. We heard very similar feedback from other flip phone users throughout our studies too. Battery is definitely a big concernand we want to optimize for long battery life as much as possible. We also want to stick to the ""designed to be used as little as possible"" philosophy of our original Light Phone. We want it to be able to help you when you're in a pickle; cuz it happens of course; but really to not encourage more usage."
Cant wait for the phone. Also agree the less add ons the better keep it simple. One question; any chance/thought of it being compatible with https://fi.google.com/about/   ?,1 year ago,From our understanding (need to research further still) we will need to have some sort of approval by Google to be able to work with Fi. We'd like to make that work; and to give our users as many options as possible for their service needs; but being that it is also a little out of our control in needing their approval we cannot guarantee it. Thanks for understanding! (and please do share more details if I'm missing something obvious)
Hope we hit the stretch goal. Fingers crossed.,1 year ago,
Stuff Im hoping for:1. Directions: so I can get to and from destinations; but I dont want Google to do the routing and tracking; so I hope theres another way it can be done. This is something Id consider a must.2. Mobile Hotspot: so I can use other devices in a pinch. I wouldnt consider this a must but it sure would be nice. Ex: broken down on side of the road and need to search for help.3. Notes: so I can take quick notes if need be. This would be a stretch and no biggie if missing.,1 year ago,"It just occurred to me that we need Medical ID on The Light Phone 2 as well.

Medical ID is really interesting; definitely taking note of that one; thanks David! Also re:directions; Google seems to be the biggest player in this; but would love any suggestions to other potential partners that could support that feature. We are skeptical of Google honestly.

ESRI can do it (I've done it using ESRI in the past) - https://developers.arcgis.com/net/10-2/phone/guide/display-driving-directions.htmOpenStreetMap can also do it - https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Routing

Really helpful; thanks David!"
As a Backer; I am happy to offer help translating technical terms into German.,1 year ago,That's super generous! At this time it is too early to understand what we will need to do to offer additional language support. In a way we are hoping there is an existing solution that we can leverage that might be suitable to use and it will be easier than we think. If we have to build it up from scratch it might be a much larger undertaking. Regardless your offer is incredibly welcomed and thank you for not only your support of our campaign but willingness to help. Cheers!
So happy to invest in a sensible product! Looking forward to having something basic and distraction free. Some of the comments here make me a little nervous. People are always looking for something MORE but that doesn't seem to be a philosophy here. It's an invitation to disconnect; and I'm very much looking forward to that. The simpler the better; in my opinion.,1 year ago,Thanks Louis!! Simpler the better; agreed! Hope that all is well.
Is the basic interface also English,1 year ago,Yep!
light phone2   Can't switch its country text display,1 year ago,Currently we are only able to guarantee English; we would LOVE to support other languages; but until we understand how much work it will require to do so; we are hesitant to promise any additional language support. In due time; we expect to offer multi-language support; it's just a matter of understanding how long that will take. Thanks for understanding!
Just wanted to say this is an amazing idea and I can't wait for the final product! I was wondering what material the phone will be made of. Thanks! SUPER EXCITED FOR THIS.,1 year ago,Hey Sean! Thanks!! We are currently assuming an aluminum back casing with our special matte glass front screen. Can't wait to share the Light Phone 2 with you :)
Congratulations! You guys clearly made a beautiful thing here. Wifi hotspot; tethering and notes are useful tools that makes it even easier to throw away the smartphone for good. Thanks.,1 year ago,Really appreciate your support! Can't wait to share the Light Phone with you :)
"I feel like I've been waiting ten years for this phone to come along. I'm troubled by a large portion of the comments below however; asking about adding Google voice; wifi hotspots; notes; tethering; what's app; blah; blah; blah. It's apparent that many people don't understand the concept of this ""unplugged"" phone. Please stay true to your vision. Less is more. Keep it simple and beautiful and don't add too many distracting functionalities. Looking forward to throwing away my iphone next April.",1 year ago,Can't wait for next April Chad! Cheers!
Hi; there was an error in the system while ordering and ended up processing twice. Please let me know how one order can be reversed.,1 year ago,"Hi Amit - We have refunded one of your pledges.  Thank you for your support!

That sucks; sorry! I believe you should be able to log into your Indiegogo account and easily refund/cancel one of the pledges. If you need help; you can email us at support@thelightphone.com and we should be able to do it with your email address on our side as well. Hope we can get that resolved quickly! Thanks for the support :)"
Great idea; I was waiting for something like that for a really long time!I have two questions though ... First of all I would love to know if you are going to somehow cooperate with developers or allow creating and installing custom apps.Second question is related to navigation. Is there a reason why to add buttons and not to catch gestures when the device has a touch display?,1 year ago,"Hello and thanks for the support! We did not originally imagine there would be such an interest in the ability for developers to create and install custom 'tools'; and we are going to try to leave that possibility open in how we think about architecting the app. It's going to be built in React Native; which as I've come to learn seems to be a pretty common framework that people would be familiar working within hopefully if we do decide to allow customization in that way...

As for physical buttons of the navigation; we will be doing lots of user testing; but from our initial paper prototyping tests it seemed to be an intuitive way to navigate the tools. The UP & DOWN buttons will provide usefulness as well in changing the volume while on a call; something that was not possible with Light 1. If in testing the physical buttons and tool box idea is proven to be ineffective; we can explore other options using gestures and the touch display. Hope that makes sense!Cheers"
Please make it happen!!!! Last time I backed a project was PEBBLE TIME2. I don't want back in that moment.,1 year ago,Did they never ship Pebble Time 2 ever? Wow; that's pretty crazy; I'm sorry. We have personally backed projects in the past as users ourselves that never came to fruition; and while we can understand how hard it is to bring a product to reality; we feel very confident in our abilities to deliver a quality product having built great partnerships in shipping our previous generation phone. Can't wait to share the Light Phone with you!
Cant wait to ditch my smartphone!  Was wondering...my only experience with eink is my kindle which is very slow to touch response.  Will this have a better response time when typing or punching in a number?  Also is the screen backlit?  How will it look in direct sun? Darkness?,1 year ago,Hi Adam; Thanks!! We are using a customized E-Ink display that utilizes their latest technologies. It's very high resolution compared to earlier models and I believe that all aspects of the touch sensitivity and  refresh rate have improved; but it is still maybe not exactly like an OLED display might feel in terms of animations/transitions. The screen will be include lighting for night use; and direct sun is where the E-Ink will be far superior to other types of screens. Hope that helps!
Do it support Korean language?,1 year ago,"To be exact; I know Its OS langauge is English but Can I recive tezt message in Korean?

Hello thank you for asking this and clarifying exactly what you mean. Unfortunately until we are able to really build out the messaging; I'm hesitant to say yes because we do not know yet how difficult that will be to do. In due time we would love to offer full language support; and maybe receiving texts as you mention in Korean will be something easy to include; but at this stage we are not sure. Thank you for understanding and for your support!

Um.... In my shoes; It is very important condition that may refund. I will consider more about funding. Can I ask one more question? I wonder a Type C phone can be used in type A area(ex-Canada) by roaming. :)

That is very understandable; and I wish that we could guarantee that support; but I also want to be honest and realistic. The three models are not exclusive to those regions but they are optimized for those regions. It is possible that a Type C would work in Canada for instance; it just may not have the full coverage that is possible in Region C. I hope that makes sense! You can learn more about the bands here - www.thelightphone.com/4gcoverage"
Perhaps my comment was missed; but I'm wondering if it's possible light phone 2 can support my Google Voice number for calling and texting? My main concern is switching phone numbers will be a pain to transition to a new phone number to use light phone 2.,1 year ago,"Hi Kevin; Sorry if I missed your comment earlier; really trying my best to get to everyone! I will admit I'm not super familiar with Google Voice. Currently are you able to call out of your smartphone (with it's own unique SIM) using your different GV number? And if so; is that only through a GV app? I'm sure forwarding to the Light Phone will work fine. I'm not sure I understand how we will be able to make outgoing calls keep your GV number; although I can see why you'd want to do that.

No worries; thank you for responding! Currently; I installed the GV app on my android phone; and it will cause the native Android Phone app to make/receive calls through my GV number. For texting; it would go through the GV app UI (alternative; I have gotten texting to work by setting GV to forward texts to my carrier number; which would then go to my native ""messages"" app; with the person's name prefixed onto the SMS text like this ""Smith - Hey Kevin""; which I am fine with doing if needed).

Thanks; Kevin; that is super helpful! This is really interesting; especially the message forwarding aspect. We will need to do some more exploring ourselves with GV I think; but our goal is to try to support all of our users in the best ways we can with the phone. We understand there are a lot of unique situations; and sometimes frustrating carrier/smartphone limitations in some instances. Thanks for understanding!"
I'm backing this phone because I'm thrilled at the idea of as few bells and whistles as possible. !   Leave out the dictionary; please !!!!!   People can use a map of their own; and a dictionary.  Simplicity and beautiful design.   The least is the The Most.,1 year ago,Well said Elizabeth; thanks for the support!
Hello; what channel to solve the problem of developer warranty after sale,1 year ago,I hope I am understanding your question correctly; but all issues with defects will be handled through our standard customer service channel which is currently - support@thelightphone.com . I hope that was helpful.
Light Phone tip: If you get a MessageBird account and request an API key; you can use the API key with an IFTTT (if this then that) recipe to get email alerts as a text message. You can set up filters as well so you just get your message from your boss and can avoid any unnecessary alerts. Only downside is you only get 10 free texts with MessageBird after that it is around 4c per text or so.,1 year ago,"Firstly; thanks so much for sharing a tip. I think this is going to prove to be one of the best parts of our little community we're building here. I tested a similar IFTTT applet with email notifications and used ""GMAIL"" ""SMS"" in the applet to text me when a specific email address emailed me. I was able to pick which pieces of the email I wanted; just subject for example; and it seemed completely free as far as I could tell. I turned it off after testing that it worked."
Would like to say how incredibly exciting it is to finally have a phone like this available!  The vibe of this comment section has largely been a discussion in regards to each one's version of an ideal utility phone.  I'd strongly recommend that this device be open to customization if possible. Bluetooth sounds necessary for people that need to talk during a drive. Ride sharing is not a luxury. What happens if you missed the last bus and your city's commute doesn't go past midnight?,1 year ago,Horacio; thank you for the support and glad that you came across our project! I completely agree that this phone can fill a very unique gap for our available options as users. We hope to allow enough customization to make the phone flexible enough for everyone's needs; seeing as everyone will have different needs. Can't wait to start really surveying everyone and getting more concrete understandings of those needs.
my two cents is that this would be PERFECT if it included a wifi hotspot. with that; it could fully replace my smartphone; and any functionality i needed for work (e-mail; social media; driving directions) i could get by tethering a laptop or tablet; which i could obviously just leave home if i needed to really disconnect. i understand this might add hardware and battery issues; and that some carriers don't allow tethering; etc. it'd be OK without it; but just wanted to weigh in!,1 year ago,Thanks Peter; I totally see what you mean with hotspot and it allowing you to really use this phone all of the time. I can see myself using it in a similar way actually. We will explore ways to do this and appreciate your understanding that yes battery may be an issue and also that not all carriers allow it; but enough do that it seems worth it to explore. Thanks for weighing in!
I'm sure it's been mentioned before; but will you provide information on the materials used and environmental impact once in production? Will there be warranty considerations?I also support using a 'tight belt' on some of the requested features. Will it be possible to 'turn off' certain tools; like the calculator? (Oblique Strategies would be a super cool easter egg; though; like something you'd find on an old iPod.)Can't stop thinking about this...so excited!,1 year ago,"Hey Cam! Thanks for bringing up this point about the materials and environmental impact; it has not really been something discussed yet in the comments or campaign.  I would love to share as much information about that aspect of the phone as we can throughout the process. It was eye opening for me to learn with the first phone  just how large scale the supply chain is. It changed how I thought as a consumer and I realized how little we tend to know as users. It's quite scary actually...

That being said; although this is something that means a lot to us; we are not revolutionizing the supply chain ourselves yet. We look at a company like Fair Phone with admiration. I think where we think we can add value as a first step is in awareness around the problem. We've come to expect such incredibly unrealistically low prices as consumers. It makes sense that the monopolies that be don't care to have us really understand this; they want us to buy a phone every year!

As for any additional 'tools'; everything will be optional. We are currently imaging a web/desktop platform to manage one's phone in which they could add tools if they wanted; but if they did not; the tool would never creep into their Light Phone. We don't want anyone to have unnecessary tools for them. In fact we will actively encourage users to challenge themselves with those things that we convince ourselves we ABSOLUTELY NEED. Thank you for the support; also so excited!"
Hello; hard working developers. If there is a problem that needs maintenance; how should we solve it!,1 year ago,fault           (Customer service)
Excited to see this develop. Youve got my money. Recently made the switch back to a flip phone without regrets. If the Light Phone 2 is anything like the video description then it should be an easy switch for anyone looking for a dumb phone. The flip phone Ive been using has a hot spot which has helped in crunch times when I need to reconnect to my old iPhone for directions or something. So that would be cool for anyone not willing to go completely light. But; the lighter the better imo.,1 year ago,Thanks Dylan! We've heard many stories just like that; and have experienced the same lack of regret in our own studies. Great to hear that the hotspot was a welcome feature in crunch times; that makes sense too. We didn't have that option on our flip phones but don't think that would have taken away from the experience. Lighter the better; couldn't agree more (and also that hotspot is a good way to offset those other tools we don't plan to ever include like email). Cheers!
I like the idea of this simple device. I think an absolute must though is bluetooth. I understand the goal of Light Phone is to get us to disconnect however there are times emergencies happen and being on the phone in a car is critical. Bluetooth will allow for legal and safe hands free usage.,1 year ago,Thanks Peter! We understand the importance of hands-free calls and really hope that we can include Bluetooth as we have seen lots of users request it for that exact reason. It seems likely at this point.
Some kind of find my phone feature would be appreciated.,1 year ago,"Hey Bradley; thanks for the support! Are you referring to a ""find my smartphone"" feature or a way to locate the Light Phone itself? Appreciate your feedback.

Yes; just the ability to locate the Light Phone itself. If I have it on silent and it slides out of my pocket into the couch; I'd like to be able to make it ring full blast from the web app. Thanks for the consideration!"
I'm a little surprised to see so many commenters asking for more features. The whole point is to simplify and disconnect. Focus on your core features and build the best quality you can. Leave out the ride share. Maximize battery and sound quality. Can't wait for April 2019. Cheers,1 year ago,Thanks for being a voice for a lighter phone. I think it makes sense that our first reaction is to want more features as we are seeing in the comments. I'm also confident from our past Light Phone users (which had no features at all but calling) and their experiences of being without a feature they thought they NEEDED ended up being a really empowering feeling to go without it. Can't wait for April 2019 either; cheers!
If you add functionality; speech translation is preferred over dictionary,1 year ago,
Could you possibly add notes? as a freelancer it would be really handy to have a feature like that to remind myself things when next at computer.,1 year ago,Hi Max; I can see how that might be useful for sure.  It's definitely an option; we are a little concerned about screen size for any long note; but I can see your point totally. Perhaps if not immediately available; you can send a message to yourself or your email (maybe using IFTTT or other) so that you could simulate that feature in an invisibile-ish way without needing a separate 'tool'? Appreciate the feedback regardless; thanks for the support!
"I am extremely excited for this. Just backed at $250. Friendly heads-up; there is a small typo under the 'Layout' section: ""This is our proposed phone layout. We're adding a custom high resolution E-Ink screen; larger microphone and [and] speaker;"" Everything is so thoughtfully designed; just wanted to help 'button-it-up' however I can.Oh... directions would be huge. That makes it a standalone replacement; at least for me. Looking forward to April '19!",1 year ago,Thanks for pointing this out!!
Addition to the wishlist: Oblique Strategies. Just hit the icon and get a card.,1 year ago,"Wow that's kind of an amazing idea. The original cards are pretty close to Light Phone size too.  This is super interesting to me; thanks for bringing this sort of untraditional tool idea up. I always thought it'd be cool to see the ringtones/sounds that Eno would think of for the Light Phone. Cheers; Jonathan!

I mean hear* the ringtones/sounds haha"
this light phone 2 is  what i'm looking for...thx for making it real cheers,1 year ago,Cheers!!
"I'm excited to back this project as this phone is actually a lifeline for me. I refuse to use any smartphone (or even a feature phone with 3g internet) for personal reasons. It's very difficult to find a simple phone that works well because I'm limited to 2g coverage. Knowing that this phone will give me the 4g coverage that I need without all the weight of an internet enabled device is a giant relief for me; especially as 2g coverage get's phased out and my ""dumb"" phones get even more obsolete.",1 year ago,That being said my dream phone would include the following Tools:1. Playlist (just the ability to load and play MP3s)2. Bluetooth (I run a business on my phone and hands free would be great; as would wireless headphones for the music)3. Directions (Would be useful but I could live without it... I already do)**Longshot Dream Wish That No One Else Will Want and I Understand Will Not Make It; Maybe?**4. Radio with Built in Antenna (what can I say... I'm an NPR Nerd)Thank you; you are my hero

I love the aesthetics; and the concept behind this! As someone who owns 2 phones and phone lines; it's almost exactly what I've been looking for to use as my second phone. Only one question - will this support whatsapp? It's integral to communications for me.,1 year ago,
A fully functional map app that can search for nearby businesses as well as look at a map is very important to me.  This + rideshare + phone/text is all I need.  Basic search features in the map app is the most important thing I want from this phone.  Only having directions to a set address is not enough.  I already have a flip phone; I don't need a fancy stylized flip phone.  I want the ability to navigate through the modern world unhandicapped without the distractions of a smart phone.TY,1 year ago,
I'm surprised so many people want Music from their phone. If this phone is about unplugging from the matrix and getting in touch with your surroundings; bringing your own jam tracks wherever you go seems to be the antithesis of the idea. Listen to the birds; the breeze; the humming of the fridge compressor. Quiet your mind.,1 year ago,
Plx no physical ports for externals! No usb. No 3;5mm-jack. Wireless charging is industry standard in 2 yrs. Bluetooth for handsfree.,1 year ago,
There are 354 comments so forgive me if I ask redundant questions.1. Using LiteOS; and pared down Android OS; will a Google account still be necessary? (part of the charm is is the idea of geting away from the corporate monoliths)2. Will unwanted features have an option to be disabled or deleted? 3. Is the battery (easily) replaceable?4. Is tethering possible (I know; it's a long shot; but it would be nice to have a tablet or full phone nearby for internet emergencies),1 year ago,"Hey! No problem at all; we're working on a unified FAQ to make it easier than scrolling through the comments; hope to have that soon. 1.Nope! (for exactly that reason)2.Unwanted features will never have to be visible on your phone at all; we are still finalizing (and excited to share) some mock ups of the UX for adding/removing 'tools'; but it will most likely happen on a desktop seems to make the most sense; or perhaps also in the settings of the phone itself. But we don't want you to...

...to have any unwanted features. 3. In our current design it's a fixed battery; similar to a a smartphone design in that way I believe.4. Tethering is something a lot of the backers have been really interested in and I can see the value. We will definitely explore and it seems totally feasible at a high level; would just be a matter of integrating it in a 'light' way. One concern is battery life drain might be significant; but there may be ways to offset that.

Thanks Joe! I really appreciate the reply."
@Martin ChamberlinNot sure why you'd think thatBT shouldn't be there but USB-C/ headphone jack is ok. All comm  endpoints and their physical controllers serve to connect you to stuff. So USB port is necessary to charge the device; but does it have to be type C? Regular microUSB 2.0 is enough. Headphone jack? If that's ok then why not BT? Many people I know don't like to be tied to wires when listening to music and it's also safer for driving.,1 year ago,
will this incorporate the swype like texting feature? just wondering cause I defiantly prefer swyping over tapping.,1 year ago,
"Thrilled to back this project and be a part of this! I wholeheartedly back this phone being ""light"" and not clogged with features. I'm curious about wifi calling/texting; and about water resistance/waterproofing. My carrier (Ting) supports wifi calling but I know not all devices do; will that be an option for this phone? And is there any chance that the phone will be waterproof/water resistant? Thanks!",1 year ago,
"I see a lot of comments asking for certain features; but I think this phone is about giving people what they need; not what they want. If your life has come to a point where bluetooth; wifi; emojis; constant digital connection; etc. have become necessities; maybe you should reevaluate your life. I don't want this to become a feature-full phone in a fashionable ""minimal"" aesthetic; please stay true to mission; don't give people what they want. Thanks for bringing this idea to fruition.",1 year ago,Well said! This is definitely something important to remember. One thing I loved learning about from the original Light Phone users was how sometimes when we don't have those things we have convinced ourselves that we absolutely NEED; we actually feel self empowered. It's easy to make one of a million excuses for needing almost any app on any given day surely; but when we overcome those excuses we feel like our best selves in those moments. It's an interesting challenge to our selves. Cheers!
Would it be possible to support some kind of wifi hotspot feature? It'd be great to be able to pop over to a tablet when necessary. Thanks!!,1 year ago,"Hey Eric! Thanks for the support. Wifi Hotspot is something that we've heard a lot of interest in; for exactly that example. We will definitely be exploring what it would take to integrate and how it could be done in a very ""light"" way. One initial concern was around battery life with hot spotting; but we also have a few ideas for potential work arounds we can explore too. Hope that all is well!"
I am glad to join your project. Can I also support Korean?,1 year ago,Glad to have you as a part of the process! Currently until we can better understand what it would take to add other language support; we are only able to promise English on the Light Phone 2. We do plan to offer language support eventually; and perhaps it will be possible by our first shipment. Thank you for understanding!
KEEP IT SIMPLE !!!! Please do not partner with large companies that collaborate with Facebook; Twitter; etc. *Playlist* is my highest preference on the maybe column.,1 year ago,Simple indeed! The last thing we'd want to do is to allow a company as clearly irresponsible as Facebook (per the news last week; that is if we even needed more proof) to access any data of our Light Phone users ever. Thank you for the support; happy to have you as a backer!
Hi; this is my first time backing a crowd funded project. I'm truly addicted to my phone and browse YouTube; social media; etc. Really needed a phone that not only looks nice; but also has the functionality that I need for my daily life. This phone seems to be the perfect fit for me! Glad to have backed it and can't wait to get my hands on it.Some ideas I had for adding tools:- Calculator- Calendar- BluetoothThese would be nice to have alongside everything else the light phone 2 offers.,1 year ago,We're honored to be your first crowdfunding campaign! Thanks for the support. We are also eager to get it into your hands :)
Reply: Thanks Joe; that does clarify a bit. When you say some carriers; is T-Mobile on the list of Pro text message forwarding? Not a show stopper; just a nice to know.,1 year ago,"No probelm! Actually you are in luck as it seems that T-Mobile offers one of the best solutions for doing this with a program they have called ""Digits"" - https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/t-mobile-digits. We want to work with them to make sure Light Phone is compatible and don't think that should be an issue. In theory would allow you to have a second SIM that is identical your original phone number; making it a super seamless second phone.

https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/t-mobile-digits not sure why the link didn't hyperlink in previous reply...

whoops; not sure why that's happening? sorry! You can copy and paste that link or Google it to learn more if you are curious."
Would there be a way to have this thing turn airplane mode on and off automatically according to a schedule? I think it would fit the light aesthetic to go light on both notifications (and RFs if youre concerned about such things). Something similar to mail fetch comes to mind; where all your texts in a specified period dont show up until the time you set beforehand. It may be similar to a do not disturb mode.  Does this make sense to anyone else?,1 year ago,"And along the same vein; it would be nice to have control over the types of bands entering the light phone. For example; LTE toggle would make sense because 3G should be able to cover most tasks at less power consumption. Also theres no need for data when navigating (just a GPS signal) once the navigation path has been loaded. Google Maps has such a feature.

Hey David; We definitely planned to have options for different ""Do Not Disturb"" and Airplane mode settings. I had not yet thought of them being scheduled automatically; but that is an interesting idea and we appreciate you sharing. I agree that having control over the ways that the phone is connecting would be great; at least in theory. I'm less technically sure how will work; but I think it's an interesting point in that we would also love to conserve battery and data as much as possible.

Thanks for the reference with Google maps too; we can look into how they do that. Is it an optional setting or something that they automatically do to avoid wasting data?

To the best of my knowledge; its an optional feature. You specify an area (box) to download an offline map. Its super useful for navigating around your city because you only need to download the whole map once rather than a portion each time you set out on a new trip. Im sure there would be a relatively easy way to temporarily download the immediate area around the route for longer trips to avoid the need for buffering so to speak; but Ive not yet seen it in a phone app."
First off... Thanks. Secondly... I've read many comments about the 3 different models and the bands they support. I also understand that there is worry over noise and clarity issues when trying to pack too many bands into a single phone. Just to be clear; this means that if I purchase a Model A phone; it cannot be used in Model C region? What of the grey zone on your map? I've backed you either way; but as a traveler I'd urge you to consider international use an important hurdle to overcome.,1 year ago,"Hello! Thank you for the support and I will try my best to clarify the bands; which can be quite confusing. Model A phone is optimized for the Region A based off the common networks carriers compatibility; however; the phone may work in other regions that also support one of the same bands; as some regions overlap in supported bands; but it may not be as reliable if only one band is supported. In other instances; maybe there is no band overlap and it may not work unfortunately.

The grey zones are not dead zones necessarily. They were regions we did not previously have customers or interest; or we could not find enough reliable information about their networks to confidently say it is compatible. Some of those regions do not have any 4G. We understand international travel is important and will continue to explore ways to make it more supported as we engineer with our hardware team. Hopefully we can find a way to make the phone more usable internationally.

Thank you for taking the time. It is good to know that there is a difference between; ""Optimized for a region""; and ""Exclusive for a region"". I was familiar with various frequencies 850/900/1800/1900; but hadn't broken it down into various bands. I'm excited for you; me; we; us; them. The ""light"" ethos is inspiring.

No problem! I believe 850/900/1800/1900 were the GSM bands of the 2G network as that is what our original phone supported as a 2G phone (quad-band it was called). I think the 4G network has many more slight variations and options for bands. Equally excited! Cheers!"
I have never backed a crowd funding project before; but I was just telling my wife that I really wish there was a simple phone that was better than a feature phone. Glad to see the extension went through; because Bluetooth is an essential tool for me (long drive).Personal Tools (for full time replacement)- Call/Voice Mail/Contacts- Bluetooth (hands free calling)- Text (group/receiving emoji)- Turn by Turn Directions (not traditional GPS Nav.)- Note - Calendar (with commenting; no sync),1 year ago,"Music would be great if it functioned similar to the Mighty player.

https://bemighty.com/

Thanks for sharing that device; it's super cool and I think even if we can't provide the same solution as them; that device is one that some of our existing users already have and it is a great companion to the Light Phone. The Light Phone cannot not compete as an ""everything"" device with the smartphone; and music does concern me with relation to battery life and not wanting to encourage more use of the Light Phone than necessary (our goal is ""designed to be used as little as possible"").

Super excited to have you as a backer; thanks for the support! I hope that we can add Bluetooth too.

I understand where your coming from; it's unfortunate though. Mighty player requires a smartphone; it doesn't have a tablet or desktop/web app. I think a quick recharge after a run would be an acceptable trade-off. I imagine the setup and sync would occur entirely within a desktop app instead of on the phone itself. This would mean no streaming or fiddling with the phone; which could save on battery. I also think this functionality would help reduce unnecessary electronic waste.

All really great points; Brock. I love how similar the way you are imagining it to where our heads are at. That trade-off is exactly that; which for some use cases like a quick run totally makes sense. I guess my concern about battery life is that sometimes I listen to music for hours and hours while traveling and currently I use an old smartphone with no SIM for that cuz the battery life is great and I can store 80+ gbs of music which with the Light Phone 2 is not possible in the form factor...

Streaming is what would really drain the battery and so maybe I'm being too cautious in my battery concerns. Your example with the desktop app would be the most efficient way for sure; and how we were also imagining it working best too. The phone screen is pretty small and we want to keep interactions with the phone super simple. Also; electronic waste is a serious point to always keep in mind; as we develop the Light Phone and as consumers ourselves. Thanks for mention it here!"
I've been needing a phone like this in my life since forever! I live for the aesthetic design and your company's ethos. I am planning to use it as my main phone so I am really hoping you will include a navigation tool (it will make me feel more secure going out and about since I have no sense of direction); and perhaps some simple clock features like timer and stopwatch (which will come in handy for studying or cooking). Simply can't wait to receive my phone! All the best!! :),1 year ago,Hi Jung! Thanks for the support; we cannot wait to share the Light Phone 2 with you. Thanks for also bringing up those sometimes forgotten subtle clock features like time and stopwatch. Those make sense to me and I think we can fit them elegantly into the clock tool. Can't wait to keep pushing the designs of everything. Hope that all is well :)
I'd really like to have NFC on this thing so I can leave my wallet behind too.,1 year ago,Hey Kenneth; Thanks for the support! I totally see what you mean by that. Wallet-free would be very light indeed. My concerns are that aside from facing the same struggle with Bluetooth of finding space for the chip; I'm also not sure of our technical abilities to securely execute payments; although maybe we could collaborate on that feature with an expert in the wireless payments space to make this possible. I just want to be realistic about our capabilities. Thanks for understanding!
Respectfully and enthusiastically requesting a calculator!,1 year ago,Hi Jennifer! Noted. I think that feels like an appropriate tool for the Light Phone 2 as well.
"My first order on Indiegogo. Never thought I would do this; but the product and the idea behind it is great.in addition to the essentials (call; message; contact; alarm) if possible: a unified messenger which supports WhatsApp; facebook chat; Kakaotalk etc.)  simple music player (no streaming app); which would be nice if you put bluetooth in the phone (wireless headphones) weather and directions would be nice but not a ""must have""ridesharing is not supported here in Germany :(Thanks!",1 year ago,Cheers; thank you! Glad we could be your first and very excited to share the Light Phone with you next year. We are not yet sure of how feasible a unified messenger will be; we definitely want to keep the aesthetics and functionality limited to that of the Light Phone device; but we see how useful such an integration could be for our users. Hopefully we can find a nice solution for everyone :) Thanks again!
Just ordered mine. I'm really looking forward to receiving it and hoping it will replace my current smartphone so I can go light more often! Calling and texting are essential; and navigation; alarm; ride sharing; calculator apps are also very welcomed and would make it much easier to leave the smartphone at home.One request I have is the ability to use wired headphones (either usb c or aux) so that I can make calls and have both hands free. Bluetooth will also be great to have.Thanks guys!,1 year ago,Thanks Brian; and well said about the features. We'd love to make it as easy as possible for you to leave the smartphone at home often.  We are currently hoping to have both aux & usb-c. Aux we have always known will be tricky to fit as it is a larger port; but we want to be able to support wired headset for hands free calling. One idea we also have is to try to even include our own matching Light branded pair that we could include with the phone if we can.
Software engr; never owned a smartphone. Features used on Sony Ericsson J105a:- Silent Mode- Alarm: Vibrate only. 5 alarms can be scheduled for the week.- Text: Threaded (conversation) view - almost all dumbphones incorrectly treat txt like email.- Calls:  One press to see call logs; separated into All; Missed; Dialed; & Answered. Can send txt msg to a nbr in the log.- Bluetooth: hands-free- Photos(?): 2x/yr; useful in txts; prob out of scopeOft thought abt doing this myself. Thanks & GL!,1 year ago,"Hi Patrick; So glad our paths crossed and thanks for sharing this feedback. We've heard similar things regarding the threaded text view from other feature phone users and understand that has been a pain point. I also like the details about the call logs; we are calling ours right now ""Recents"" and imagine similar functionality; so this is helpful to see. Thanks for the support!"
I would love to have weather; waterproofing; and maybe a calendar sync on this! Even if not; everything on the phone so far looks like exactly what I want!,1 year ago,Thanks for the support Lawrence. Waterproofing would be so nice; I agree. We were hesitant to promise that as a feature at this stage; but I know it is one of Kaiwei's goals so hopefully we can pull it off.
This is an amazing concept; cant wait for it to arrive. 2 thing that would be great (if possible) would be :- a. Navigation & b. Messaging (whatsapp/wechat/telegram) Then i could completely ditch the smartphone.,1 year ago,"Wonderful feedback; thanks so much for the support. It's going to be a really exciting next year. I hope that we can find a suitable messaging solution that doesn't compromise the ""lightness"" of the phone while still working for all of our users beyond SMS. Thanks for understanding."
Also; call blocking is a must have.,1 year ago,"Hey Paul; Just want to clarify; do you mean being able to block a specific phone number from being able to call you in the future?  Like a ""block list"" I think would be the term? Thanks!

Yes; exactly that."
I only need phone; text; and uber/Lyft. I do NOT want to have to keep my smartphone.,1 year ago,Thanks Paul! We are not 100% sure about Uber/Lyft feasibility yet; but we have already opened up the conversation to see what will be possible; and hope that we can find a suitable solution so you can ditch your smartphone :)
Can this phone read PDF?,1 year ago,At the moment; we did not imagine the phone would read PDFs; but rather simple SMS messaging. I hope that makes sense! Thanks for the support.
Keep it as simple as possible. The light phone 2 in my     Pocket and my smartphone in my bag only for use when I really need it. Phone;SMS and alarm is the essential.  Nobody leaves their smartphone at home when they leave for work anyway.,1 year ago,Love hearing as simple as possible! That is definitely our goal. Thanks for the support :)
Looks like a cool product. Here are some of my thoughts.From the maybe list; the ones that I would use are:* Navigation (possibly with public transport directions and some simple ability to get the phone number of restaurants)* Music playlist (local library)* Weather* Calculator* Alarm clock* Stopwatch* TimerThere are 3 other things that I think would be nice to see. * Reminders/Calendar* Notes (+ voice memos)* Tethering/hotspot (to use 4G data on a tablet or laptop for work),1 year ago,
My priority would be water/weather proof (IP6X) rating: so I'm not worried about sweat; rain; or snow.USB tethering would be enough to make it my ONLY phone; BT or WiFi hotspot would also work; but may be a bit more difficult for you to implement.,1 year ago,We would love to be able to make the phone waterproof! I know that is something Kaiwei is really hoping to make possible; but at the moment we cannot guarantee it. I totally see where you are coming from though. Tethering does make sense and is something we will for sure explore as we understand for many that will make this a suitable ONLY phone. One high level concern is battery life but USB tethering might resolve that (charging simultaneously perhaps).
What a great idea - a 'stupid' phone that won't make me hate myself by looking at it. I echo the comments that request the phone only have a few new features to keep it from getting too counterproductive: calls; SMS; Maps; and music (preferably some way to sync a playlist or two from a streaming service like Spotify). Like many on here; I commute via public transit and some way of accessing streamed music is a must. Everything else can wait until I'm at a destination!Happy to back this!,1 year ago,Happy to have you as a backer; Christine!! Thanks for sharing this and can't wait to share the Light Phone with you :)
As soon as I saw the Light phone I fell in love; the design; concept and the product is really amazing; the team at Light Phone should be very pleased. I'm a seasoned 'dumb phone' user; so hopefully this will becoming my daily driver. I just can't wait to get it :) the old fashioned dumb phones are irritating in their user interface. I think of this as a 'dumb phone' for the modern age.,1 year ago,Thanks Max; glad you saw our campaign and were willing to support! Couldn't agree more about 'dum phone' options; I've personally tried a few different ones over the past year in testing; and there were many irritating interface moments that we hope we can deliver a better solution for. Can't wait to share the Light Phone with you!
Hi. I love the look of the phone. I have a watch with an e-ink display and it suffers quite a lot from ghosting. Have you managed to get round this?I think having a display that doesnt show pictures or videos will break the vicious cycle of starting at your smart phone for hours on end. However; to make it possible for me to ditch mine I would need mobile hotspots; directions; a text version of WhatsApp; a calendar that syncs with google and music (with Bluetooth aptx HD please),1 year ago,Hey Chris! Great point regarding E-Ink and ghosting. We've been working with them on a customized display; using their latest technology and  highest resolutions. So far in what we've seen ghosting has not been obvious; but that is something to be aware of for sure. Thanks for pointing that out.
Hi. I think I was out of order signing up for this. How do I cancel the order/arrange a refund? (Im not sure if any money has been charged yet),1 year ago,Hi Ken; No problem. I believe if you are logged in to your Indiegogo account you should be able to see a refund option. If you are having trouble finding it you can also email us at support@thelightphone.com and we can look it up on our end and refund your order that way. Thanks again for spending time with our project and hopefully we can share a Light Phone with you one day in the future:)
Just been reading through the new comments...to be fair there's a fair few wondering if epub is an option.To be honest; if the chance of having on the phone could be done but then make it a personal choice; think it's worth looking at. I think it'd be cool for me to be able to have a read; though Joe; always gonna agree a physical book is a beautiful thing.,1 year ago,"Hey Stu! It will be great once we do surveys to quantify the priorities even more; because yeah we have seen a fair few wondering about epub. Regarding those; I'm a little less familiar with how one would want them to work on a Light Phone 2.  Do you tend to own your epubs and would just need a way to upload them or do you use a service to ""rent"" or store them and we'd need to collaborate with a partner for it be really useful? Thanks for any feedback you can share on that would be great!

In general I tend to agree that if it is possible and not completely against our philosophy we should allow the user the option. The bigger issue I think is around prioritization because we do have limited resources; we want to make sure we use them as wisely as possible at this stage. Hope that makes sense! And hey; glad to hear I'm not alone in my love for physical books :)

Hey Joe; from what I gather; you download them straight onto a device; if it aas your pc; it'd sit in your downloads folder then with a double click and away you go. So yeah; you own them; it's like open source I suppose.Like you said though; anything on the 2 has to be something that is worth having.I'm mainly just looking forward to next year though mate. I'll be happy with whatever comes my way : ) And 'Book Lovers Unite!'

That makes sense; thanks for that Stu. Can't wait until next year; cheers!"
"I love this idea! If I were to permanently replace my ""smart"" phone with this product i'd be wanting Call; Text; Contacts; Alarm; Clock; Calculator....that's pretty much it; keep it light like it says :)  waterproofing would be cool Can't wait for this!",1 year ago,Thanks Brandon; happy to have you as a backer:) Agree; waterproofing would be so cool; and it doesn't seem impossible yet. Cheers!
Of al of our stretch goals having the phone act as a wifi hotspot would be perfect. So I could just use my iPhone as computer. never a phone,1 year ago,That is an interesting idea for a stretch goal. Bluetooth might make hotspot easier as well. I've said in a few other comments one concern about hotspot is battery life; but we have a few ideas that can maybe offset that a little bit. Thanks again for the support!
Maybe I missed this features; but Will it be possible to forward a line to the light phone? That way when I am working and need to access my work email via Blackberry Works; I can just unforward my line and my iphone can be the primary? Or will I need to pass the SIM between the two devices? Ultimately; I would like one phone number but the ease of flipping between phones when appropriate.,1 year ago,"Hi Chris; Thanks for the support and sorry for not making this more clear; unfortunately it is a little confusing and sometimes out of our control as users. You can certainly forward calls to the Light Phone; that is currently how our original phone receives incoming calls. Unfortunately; most carriers don't offer a way to easily forward text messages. We will continue to explore and layout all the ways you can make it easier to integrate the Light Phone into you lifestyle; and there is...

...nothing more that I would like than that ease of flipping between phones easily. That was and still is our end goal; and we will be continuing to push to make that possible with various carriers and device makers currently holding that functionality back from us; the users. I hope that makes sense and thanks for understanding. Feel free to follow up with a more specific question if that did not clarify things for you. Best; Joe"
My primary phone number is through Google Voice (GV) and right now I use the GV app on my android phone to make calls and send text messages. Is it possible to support GV for calls/text on Light Phone 2?If not; would it be possible to use this phone on Google Project Fi?,1 year ago,
"Question about the Black/White Option... it is my understanding that the E-Ink displays can really be either mode (the energy consumption is in the transition). Will there be an ""Invert Display"" option somewhere in LightOS to allow us to change it (Day / Night mode). If so; is the Black/ White option solely for the case material?  Thanks!",1 year ago,"White/Black option does refer to the case material. We originally did not imagine a mode for inverting the screen colors because we like the idea that the information would seem ""borderless"" because the screen background color would match the phone perfectly. In theory it may be totally possible and easy to have that option; and perhaps we can explore it. The screen will be lit so that we imagine both version being visible in both daylight and night time. Hope that helps!"
Email and Bluetooth please! Love the design. Hope kindle app will work there.,1 year ago,
agreed with Robbo. Keep it super light; that's the idea.,1 year ago,Yep! Totally agree.
All these comments wanting more features. I just want texting & calling. Ive currently got a re-released Nokia 3310 & its great. Previously Ive had all iPhones & the Nokia is great because it only has the basics; no distractions.,1 year ago,"Well said; Robbo. We are definitely trying to make a super simple phone; not an ""everything"" phone. Thanks so much for the support; looking forward to sharing the Light Phone with you!"
This sounds like exactly the kind of phone ive been looking for! Would love if it came with a calculator; navigation; and streaming (like an app for downloading podcasts and music) applications!,1 year ago,
"I think the video says it all; ""How can I go light more often."" All of the stretch items are imperative; in my opinion; to make this possible.",1 year ago,
I fell in love with the design and the features of this brilliant product.I wish that my Light Phone 2 will replaces my smartphone definitively.Call + Message + Contacts + Clock + Alarme will be enough for me.Tool like Calculator will be awesome; Directions and other of what you thinking would be cool.Can't wait to use this in France.,1 year ago,I forgot to say that the option Vibrator for Call/Message would be necessary.Waterproofing will be great if it's possible.
My cell phones use Verizon as my carrier and my wife uses Cricket; I checked with both to see if I can use a duplicate SIM card and both said no. I'm curious if you know what carriers in the US allow duplicate SIM cards or if there is some other method I can use to allow me to leave my iPhone home on occasion and still get calls and texts on the Light Phone 2.,1 year ago,"Hi Mark; The two US carriers that have the most advanced programs for doing such are TMobile (Digits program) and ATT (NumberSync program).  Forwarding calls to the Light Phone is always an option and we can share a few ways for doing so. Messaging is a little trickier although there are a few ways that you can at least let the sender know via auto-reply message that they can text you at xxx-xxxx number or call if it is urgent.  I hope that makes sense!

I really wish there was a way for us to build a seamless solution to forward and mask all outgoing/incoming calls and messages to the Light Phone as your primary number. We will continue to explore every possible option for doing so; and are really sorry that the telecommunications world is so behind in giving us as users said features. I know this sounds really confusing; but...

we've had thousands of users use the original Light Phone as a second phone with a unique number and it was not as weird as we initially thought. If you do have a second number; you share that with close friends/family so they recognize your calls/texts from the Light Phone; and you can turn on call forwarding/auto-reply so that they can still reach you on the correct device. It's not perfect; but it's a step towards carriers understanding this is something users WANT and deserve hopefully."
Before we could reach the height stretch goal; we need a longer amount of time; or else its not fare to the backers! Thanks!:-(,1 year ago,Hey! Thanks for sharing this; we are working with IG now to see if we can maybe extend the campaign; seems like we can; will keep everyone posted :)
I pretty much agree with where you're already at:Call; text; alarm; directions (I live in NYC - PLEASE directions!); ride sharing (see previous statement!); weatherThanks so much for this - truly!,1 year ago,"Hey Danielle! Thanks for the support :) We're also NYC based; prior to shipping the first Light Phone we had a little get together for local backers; hopefully we can do something like that in the future too before we kick off mass production or maybe even after this campaign just to say ""hi"" to everyone. Anyway hope all is well and thanks again for the support!"
I know this sounds lame; but I gotta be able to read work e-mails! Also; calculator; notes; and music with bluetooth headphones?,1 year ago,
I really like your design. It's a charming mobile phone. My receiving address is in Chinese;Will this affect my receipt of your products?,1 year ago,Hello and thank you for the kinds words and support. I do not think this is an issue and we will be following up after the campaign to confirm everyone's address at which point we can verify that it's an appropriate address provided. Thank you again and hope all is well!
Hey I just wanna say I love this design coupled with the idea; the simplicity is soooo attractive and futuristic. In terms of features I think Bluetooth would be a nice addition as well as a micro sd card slot to play stored mp3 files from would also be a nice touch. Once again I really appreciate what youre doing!,1 year ago,Also Im not sure if this was a factor before but perhaps the capacity to receive voicemails?
"SO excited for this phone.  On the list of ""maybe's"" I would like to add that our priorities would be 1. Navigation2. Playlist (streaming?)3. Ride-Share4. Voice Command5. CalculatorEverything else is take it or leave it for us.Can't wait for these to start shipping.  Looking forward to future updates on the project!",1 year ago,
Stoked!  Can we fast forward to April 2019 yet?I agree that there have been some cool feature requests; but I think keeping it simple would be best.  If bluetooth & a mini flashlight can be added awesome; if not I think you've nailed the basics:-Phone Calls (with some sort of DND/Muting/Away Message feature)-Texts-Navigation-Alarm-Rideshare (doesn't matter which company to me)-Limited song storage (assuming downloaded and transferred podcast files would work also?),1 year ago,
I am really excited for this product; very much what I am looking for! As far as functionality; I really don't need much more than texting; alarm clock; calculator. I cannot understate how much I do not want to see any type of web browser; I'm tired of constantly feeling the need to be distracted.,1 year ago,
I have to say that I'm quite hyped up for this; and I think you guys have to incorporate the following essential tools: a calculator; an alarm clock; a ride sharing app; a directions app. Also; I wonder if it will support other languages (such as Arabic). Looking forward to this !,1 year ago,
Hotspot will be a nice addition; some kind of maps or something similar for navigation; some kind of messaging other than sms; no one I know use sms anymore. Music player? I can have phone without it; no problem. Calculator; calendar and contacts with sync; may be app to take notes; weather; clock with alarm.,1 year ago,
Bluetooth and Torch are some of the most demanding features as I can see. And something that caught my mind was the minimal WhatsApp version. Would love to see that. Only text-based WhatsApp with no other functionality. And that's probably it with the most basic features. 6 Days to go and cant even wait for the Survey. Excited and curious to know!,1 year ago,
some comments speak about adding a flash light and I feel that might be okay but if it compromises battery life then I wouldn't mind keeping it off I would really appreciate if the phone could have as much battery life as possible would prefer to be disconnected to cables as much as I can thanks for your great product I can't wait!,1 year ago,WATERPROOFING AS WELL SORRY FOR SO MANY COMMENTS ;)
Love your idea and am super stoked for mine! I would really hope you guys decide to add directions (adventuring and car rides); some form of music capabilities ( i use apple music but would not mind switching over to another form of streaming ); bluetooth (bluetooth speakers and earphones); and calculator/dictionary( splitting meal checks and a dictionary just sound like tools you may need).,1 year ago,
"Like many have said here; I too am excited for this phone. I would also echo the sentiment to KEEP IT SIMPLE and resist the ""one more feature"" trap. The soul of this phone is too have base functionality to give the user an opportunity to disengage from technology and reengage with humanity. Please; please don't lose sight of this. To those that really want to add more features; please consider other products for that; such as Jelly. Let's not spoil the simple concept that we have here! :-)",1 year ago,
Very excited for this phone. I've been wanting something exactly like this for a while now. I'm not sure if this is already included since there is time; but a simple calendar (doesn't even have to store events) would be nice in order to see what day it is and which days are coming up!,1 year ago,
BUT A Phone without light won't be light! So hopefully you'll add a LED lamp!,1 year ago,
As an upcoming industrial designer I just have to say that this is real design imo! Design doesnt mean creating one more stylish bezeless mainstream Phone. Design means reflecting the society not for searching a market for mainstream products rather then searching what it really needs. This is the reason for me to support this simple essential product solution for this huge social problem to set a countertrend!,1 year ago,Cheers Nathanael! Thanks for the support; can't wait to share the Light Phone with you.
What about all of us iMessage users... Will we have to deregister from iMessage every time we want to use the LP2 in order to get our texts? Thanks,1 year ago,"Hi Nick; Thanks for bringing this point up. I also use iMessage; and I imagine there will be a few different options depending on your situation; but also that because it is proprietary it may not be fully seamless. I know I like to put up away messages (as outlined in our last update - https://medium.com/the-light-phone/setting-up-an-away-message-fd3efd856f0b); but it is not a perfect loop able to forward messages. Perhaps If This Than That might have a solution that works for some?

Others will be able to get a duplicate SIM (TMobile Digits or ATT Number Sync for example) which should receive the messages on both phones; sent via text; but it will be great to brainstorm with our users the best ways to overcome that proprietary hurdle."
I would love to be able to add my books (epub) to my light phone. Just for long train journeys or flights. Better to read some quality fiction than get lost on social media. But I do agree that if too much is added then the light phone 2 becomes less lightTotally understand if you feel ebooks deviate too much from your original concept. Definitely dont want to see any social media apps though,1 year ago,"Hey Chris! As a big reading fan myself; I agree a quality book always trumps social media. My biggest concern about e-books is less about deviating from concept; although anything like music or books than encourage you to use the device do sort of go against the ""designed to be used as little as possible"" principle; but rather the small screen size being an inadequate for reading long texts like that. I also just love physical books still and enjoy that experience. Definitely no social media!"
I'm reading all these comments and appreciate that people want the features you all have set out to build; PLUS their one-teeny-little-extra request. I'm tempted to do the same. BUT; I also view this project as an attempt to save some of us from ourselves. As you consider user requests; please stay true to your original mission. The marketplace will benefit from something boldly different. Any app/feature that someone can interact with like a cigarette I hope you ruthlessly cut.,1 year ago,Hi Danny; Thanks so much for the support! I appreciate your understanding of the balance of wanting to add more features while staying true to original mission. Something I think may hopefully happen to many of us is that when you try going light and don't have that app that you were convinced you couldn't live with out; and yet there you are living with out it; it's actually quite empowering. So although we all have the urge to add one more feature; I'd encourage everyone to consider that too.
A call blocking feature would also be appreciated. Its nice to block robocallers and unwanted texts.,1 year ago,
A Do Not Disturb feature similar to iOS would be much appreciated. iOS allows me to only receive calls from certain people (i.e. family contacts) and everyone elses phone calls and texts are muted. It is a wonderful way to disconnect while staying connected to my wife and kids. My phone rings and I know its family. Everyone else can leave a message.,1 year ago,"Yep! We plan to offering more options for how you chose to be notified. The previous Light Phone also had a filter feature actually and I leave my iPhone permanently on DoNotDisturb and can say it's made a huge difference in the last two years (recommend trying that as a little light step if anyone has not). We also imagine being able to set up automated text responses; call blocking/filtering; and airplane mode etc... things we consider aspects of the ""best simple phone""."
I think that WhatsApp is an essential messaging service. I agree that if used incorrectly it can be more of a social network with things like groups; statuses etc. But the truth is that SMS/MMS is really just the way that people communicate anymore; Whatsapp without support for images/statuses etc is the minimalist version that I think a lot of people would like?,1 year ago,

Congrats on make it to the  $1M. I hope that another $1/2 million comes in to make the Bluetooth stretch goal. Everyone help spread the word and bring some humanity back into this world.,over 1 year ago,
Guys; What we don't want would be:WhatsApp; Facebook; Twitter; Instagram; Snapchat and every other app that forces you to look at your smartphone. Simple! and Clear!,over 1 year ago,
So happy to join! I'd love for a playlist function; with maybe the option of playlist+a radio station (i.e. a focus station that doesn't need to be a playlist). Would love for a simple podcast option (I saw pocketcast being mentioned in comments).Maps (and public transport info) would be great + I like the idea of a calendar at-a-glance. I realise this is maybe going against the philosophy; but I'd love to be able to have a group chat function within the text (simply for family communication).,over 1 year ago,
Spent last night jumping around for joy; finally joined the gang! Popped on here to see what you guys had been saying; jumped a bit more when I saw Joe mentioning about apps; and the possibility of making your own or downloading simple ones; I'd like to be able to read on it (that's just me though). I saw someone mention about making the phone bigger (for a bigger battery) begging you don't; it's the most gorgeous piece of kit; utterly perfect and I'm a stickler for looks! Can't wait to get it.,over 1 year ago,
Is the phone can be a hotspot ?,over 1 year ago,
No. Whatsapp is not essential. It defeats the entire purpose of going light since whatsapp is more a social network then a communicative one. MMS is essential. If you want skype or whatsapp that's what a tablet or laptop is for via hotspot.,over 1 year ago,
Since it is a 4G phone please include whatsapp as it is essential for today communication.,over 1 year ago,
Joe;I read your response to Vincent Vallejo regarding additional perks to help reach the stretch goal and I'd like to throw in my support. A case; dock and customized headphones sound great and I'd be happy to invest a little more for those as I don't particularly need a second phone. Perhaps having headphones that are proprietary to the phone will help eliminate all of the unknown of Bluetooth capabilities with certain brands. Thanks for being so active with us and congrats on hitting $1M!,over 1 year ago,
Hello LP2 team and friends;Obviously simple means different things.. Please keep in mind that we could all buy a dumb phone with lots of features; if we wanted simple. I spent a year working in India and there were a lot of cool feature phones there. I am hoping you are making a MODERN simple phone. I am backing for the beauty of what your proposing. For me that is a beautiful screen and :Music; GPS; Alarm clock and weather proof. Also; I do a lot of travel I hope you all will sell a case.,over 1 year ago,
Exciting product. I had a similar idea (phone with e-ink) but you guys were faster!I think regarding this phone the battery is really important. I wouldn't mind the phone being a little more thicker and heavier with a bigger battery.,over 1 year ago,
"I pulled the trigger and am very excited. 380 days and counting. I just have 2 big hang ups I hope will be implemented. 1. music. I'm in a city where I'm in my car a lot and have just recently sold all my CD's & Vinyl. Having  compatibility with today's most popular music streaming service; Spotify; would make this a complete package to get rid of my smartphone for good! 2. Hotspot. Again with the car thing; having ability to do ""emergency"" e-mail response on the go is critical. thanks!",over 1 year ago,
I just pulled the trigger and bought one! I can't wait for next year. One of the most beautiful things about this phone is that there are no logos on its screen. We see branding everywhere already. My worry is if you include 'tools' like uber; lyft; or spotify; you'll be forced to include their logo. I think this should be the ultimate determining factor for whether or not it belongs on this phone. Instead of  Rideshare; how about a taxi directory? Instead of Spotify; what about FM reception?,over 1 year ago,Hi Sam! Glad to have you as a backer. I love that as one potential rule of thumb; no logos. I couldn't agree more about branding everywhere. I live in NYC and it's really a drag sometimes how there is literally advertising on every square inch it seems.  Both interesting alternatives; thanks for voicing them. Cheers!
I just wanted to elaborate on the idea of incorporating MMS for text-only; as a platform it is used to create a 'conversation' with multiple recipients which I feel would be beneficial towards the communication aspect of the device without compromising on its simplicity. I know I would appreciate being able to participate in group messages between family/friends on this device! Very excited to see what this project will produce,over 1 year ago,
Hi Joe;Hope you are well too. Thanks for an amazing response. Definitely the option to create own tools is a wise take on customisation. I did some UI designs (m a designer ;-)) and concepts when Jolla smartphones where in highlight few years back. Jolla 2 was something I looked upto. So if you need any support with marketing and designs let me know. Id love to help the community and The Light team.. :-),over 1 year ago,
"I've tried on multiple occasions to ""go light;"" but the idea is much better than the reality: hence the reason I support this project.  I figured that the latest/last Nokia candy bar phone would allow for serviceable call/SMS support.  Not even close.  iPhones are actually good at making calls.  And most smartphones will randomly send MMS for text-only.  Light 2 needs to be able to get the text out of MMS.",over 1 year ago,Interesting point re:MMS for texts; we will definitely need to investigate that.  Thanks for bringing that up and hope that you have a wonderful weekend ahead! Cheers.
One thing I use my smartphone for today is to create a wifi hotspot. You should add that to your phone. Then if I need something more demanding I can use my laptop that I usually carry in my bag.,over 1 year ago,Yes; a few others have brought this exact point up. I like that one could get actual work done or look things up perhaps with the laptop; but then once one closes the lid and goes out there with just the Light Phone 2 in your pocket; you would not be distracted with email or other. It is something we will definitely consider. One potential concern is battery life in doing so; but maybe you'd also plug the phone to the computer to charge simultaneously?
Was just wondering what will be th customisation limits for Calendar; Alarm and Maps tools. Will it have a dedicated app store? Like SailfishOs or something very small but a handy catalog.,over 1 year ago,"Hi Ali; hope all is well. We have not fully defined those limits yet. Originally we imagined for simplicity sake that there would be very little need for customization; but from hearing feedback so far we are trying to understand other ways to allow customization; including the ability to build your own apps perhaps? We don't have the ""tools"" interface fully defined and are open to other ideas; and we like the idea of web based way for users to pick and choose the few features they need."
Maybe this question has already been asked and answered; but will there be a calendar app? Not actually for setting appointments and cloud syncing and reminders; etc.; but just for an at-a-glance view of the calendar?,over 1 year ago,"Hi Ray; Calendar is something will be exploring with everyone; it is possible; but similarly to any of the ""potential features"" we are not 100% sure there will be a calendar. If included I like your idea of at-a-glance only! Thanks for sharing."
I'd prefer to not be able to install tools via the phone itself. If there's a tool that I feel is on my unwanted list; I wouldn't want the ability to install it on a whim. I like the web browser settings idea however. Also; I think I may be too excited about this phone. I printed a phony Light 2 on a 3-D printer LOL.,over 1 year ago,Very good point; I think that makes total sense. I guess our concern was that actually not everyone has a computer; but I agree that for a variety of reasons  like what you mention about not being able to install on a whim to the small screen size making the experience more limited. A web browser would be the more ideal interface for sure. Love the enthusiasm!!
Hey; just a couple thoughts (And sorry if these are echoed by others; I haven't finished reading all other comments): 1. A note taking app would be great. 2. Expandable storage via SD card. Mostly for music; but has other uses.3. Is it possible to host all apps on your site for download and add them via usb as we need/want them? It seems like there are some great ideas here but inevitably none of us are going to agree on which are essential because we all live life a bit differently.,over 1 year ago,Hi Zachary; 2. seems a little hard to include perhaps at this point; as it requires significant hardware change; but I do see your point. Regarding our 'tools'; we do imagine something like that either in the settings of the phone itself and/or a web page as it is true; essential is different for every user; and I'm so glad we are learning from everyone with this campaign. Ideally it would happen wirelessly too. We want everyone's phone to have what they need and NOTHING more :)
Im sure this is a less requested feature; but any chance a hotspot will be a feature?,over 1 year ago,It actually has been something we have heard a lot about and with some pretty convincing use case ideas in support of it. Although we cannot say for sure yet; I will say it has definitely piqued our interest to explore more deeply. Especially for users than intend to use this as their only phone; it could be a great way to make it easier for people to make the jump and offset some of those other functionality to a tablet or laptop via hotspot. Thanks for adding another opinion; cheers!
"Can't wait to get my hands on the phone; and hopefully I will be able to not use my smartphone at all. What love too have the messaging app support different messaging apps. For example when you send a message; you can choose to send the message through Telegram's platform or just in the ""normal"" way. One messaging app to rule them all",over 1 year ago,That seems like a great potential UX solution for handling messaging with different platforms; but with out further investigation with those teams it is too early to say for sure that it will be possible. That's an awesome idea though and appreciate you taking the time to share.
I have a dumbphone for 5 years now because I'm too addicted to news feed and I found it too stressful to recharge my phone every day. The only app I really miss is google calendar. I have to be near a computer to tell someone if I will be available.  Is it something you are considering implementing ?Thanks.,over 1 year ago,Hello! Whoa 5 years is long time; it's great that you were able to recognize that and take the action to remove the smartphone from your life; inspiring! We are still considering all of the features and calendar is in that bucket of potential features; but it is too early for us to promise that calendar will be there for sure. It is definitely under consideration. Thank you for sharing that feedback and appreciate your support!
Hey; getting excited about this; so I'm wondering if I can get a refund of my original 1x perk so that I can go for the 2x perk instead to get one for my wife too. Is this possible? If so; how? Thanks.,over 1 year ago,Hi Alexander; Amazing; looking forward to sharing a Light Phone with both of you.  I believe the only way to do so is  to cancel your pledge and then go through the process again for the other perk (directions for canceling pledge - https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/213172367 ). If have any trouble with cancelling your perk; email me at - joe@thelightphone.com and I can do so by looking up your pledge on our end. Hope that was helpful; thanks again for the support!
Great to read all the comments and see the excitement around the project. My goal is to permanently ditch the smart phone which I use for work so wanted to give a shout out to some of the other ideas people had below:- phone- text / group text (ability to auto reply to an incoming call)- calculator - clock / alarm - maps / directions with ETA can be very useful- Uber or Lyft partnership would be great; although taxis still work- do not disturb mode / times- ability to turn cellular off,over 1 year ago,Appreciate it Garrett! Looking forward to sharing surveys with everyone and learning even more once the campaign ends. Cheers!
Cool!! I guess one thing that could be awesome is to have a Fitbit app. Or an option for it. So we can still use our Fitbit with this amazing Phone ?,over 1 year ago,Hey John! Unfortunately as it stands; I'm unsure we will be able to support the Fitbit app.  Thanks for understanding and sorry to disappoint!
Very excited for this phone. However; if you do end up adding superfluous functions (Spotify; etc) due to public voting; am I able to get a refund of my money?I understand the phone details are fluid; but I'm contributing for a simple phone. Adding music apps is equivalent to social media apps; neither of which I allow on my phones.,over 1 year ago,"Thanks for bringing up this point! I can assure you that any such features will be completely optional (even messaging is optional if you wanted only phone calls). Public voting will be important in understanding everyone's needs; but we will only integrate those ideas that are actually aligned with the simplicity of the Light Phone (and of course always optionally).  Social media will never be on the phone and even the word ""app"" feels wrong for describing potential features.

I hope this makes sense; we really are interested primarily in a simple phone that is designed to be used as little as possible. Anything that makes you want to ""fiddle"" with your phone; even if rationalized as a ""tool"" or ""utility""; is a contradiction to the philosophy behind the Light Phone.  Hope that all is well; thanks again for contributing and sharing your voice here.

Thank you for the reply; Joe. What about my question about the refund? I don't mean to be a dick; but $260 is a lot of money to drop on something that I might not ultimately be happy with. I just want to be sure of such a commitment.I understand that any functions added will be optional; but as someone who carried around a smartphone with no additional apps other than the pre-installed ones; I don't really like to even have the option. Perhaps they could be disabled; or hidden?

Regarding the refund of your pledge; we don't have a formal policy yet; but have always given any of our previous backers the option of a refund for their pre-order with no questions asked. I do agree $260 is a lot of money and it's amazing that we have such trusting supporters honestly. I also agree that any unwanted functionality should be completely invisible and hidden. We are working out the exact details of how that UX might work and it sounds like we're on the same page so far.

Perfect; that puts my mind at ease. I'm excited to hold this bad boy. Two more thoughts: 1) the best battery life you can squeeze in; I love that my flip phone lasts 3-4 weeks 2) e-ink screens are soft. Any thoughts to a protective layer or cover to keep it from getting scratched in pockets? Thanks again!"
I backed this because I love the idea of a pared down phone with calling; messaging; and little else. A map? Ok. Although if I'm somewhere I need a map; I'll probably just take my regular phone. Bluetooth? I'm not so sure. At some point Light Phone becomes so laden with features; it's no longer light. In fact; what I'd love (if it's workable) is a proprietary messaging system so one could communicate with a select group rather than the usual cast of thousands. Just my 2. Keep up the great work!,over 1 year ago,"Hi Andrew; Completely agree that the point of the phone is to be very paired down. Bluetooth; if included; we can assure you would not interrupt any of the normal phone flow and would be off by default.  There are a few things like syncing contacts with your smartphone in which bluetooth might actually help us make the experience even 'lighter'. We could not agree more that too many features will make it no longer feel light; and completely contradicts the philosophy of the Light Phone.

Thank you for your reply; Joe. I can see how syncing via bluetooth might be a ""lightener."" And I have faith in you and your team to keep things as blissfully simple as possible."
We will be able to lock or phones with a simple passcode; right?,over 1 year ago,"Good point! Short answer; yes. It might be worth us doing a more detailed update regarding some of what we are internally considering ""basic phone functionality"" like being able to set a lock/passcode; mute a call; turn on/off ringtones; voicemail; forward calls or set up auto reply functionality. We did not elaborate on these details in the campaign; but these are things we are considering important to being the best simple phone. Thanks for bringing up this point."
"This is sorely needed in the market! I downgraded from a Nexus 6P to a ""feature"" phone a year and a half ago to detach myself from electronic distraction; and have been missing a couple things: GPS (Google Maps) and functional group text messaging. If this phone can handle both of those extras well then I think it will be a big success. Also - I think there's a big uncaptured market for parents who want to give a phone to their kids; but don't feel comfortable giving a full smartphone to them.",over 1 year ago,Hi Jordan! Thanks for the support! We met many other feature phone users who expressed similar pain points and it is some of the inspiration for this second generation phone. We learned how powerful the full jump away from the smartphone could be and wanted to give those truly 'light' users a better option. I don't have group text fully worked out; but it's something we are more than aware of and look forward to hopefully finding a very suitable solution that works for everyone.
Please include Calculator function.  It is a tool; and although I don't use it regularly; it is very useful to have when you need it.  Personally; I see the calculator as a tool; and think it fits nicely into your Swiss Army knife paradigm.  Thank you very much for being dedicated to this less is more phone initiative!,over 1 year ago,I totally see your point; and agree that a calculator does not feel like a contradiction to the phone as tool idea at all. Thanks for sharing that Dean.
I absolutely love your product!!!  There's a demand for phones that are just phones.  I'd love to see you keep as close as possible to the core concept and keep things simple.  Less is more :)- Independent phone- calls- sms with qwerty keyboard- contacts listIf you made a version that simple I'd choose it.  I can only speak for myself but I don't even want to see the time on my phone.  Remember when phones weren't clocks? (i know others want the time though so I'm just dreaming),over 1 year ago,"Hey Chris; I actually find this to be a really amazing point and thanks for bringing it up. In our original Light Phone we actually made the time optional; so that the phone could not tell the time if you so chose. Obviously not for everyone; but I do really love getting lost in my work and losing track of time myself. So I should have mentioned that we do plan to offer a few options for the time; including the ability to disable it (others being 24-hour and maybe a few analog style clocks)

Thanks Joe; thats amazing :) . Keep up the good work!"
LOVE my first Light Phone and I look forward to this new version too! I'm glad that by the time 2G is gone in the US; I'll have the new phone by then.,over 1 year ago,So so happy to have your original support with the Light Phone. We would not be here today with out that; thank you! We also are looking forward to sharing this next Light Phone with you. I hope that all is well; thanks Naomi!
Oh man; make the active area longer please :D,over 1 year ago,Hi Bertrand; Thanks for mentioning this; I really wish that we felt it was possible to do so; but unfortunately it does not seem possible to do so per our current engineering layout. We hope that you can understand!
Completely new to indiegogo (this is my first purchase) but have you considered a perk for more backing to reach your stretch goal? I purchased 2 phones already and don't think I need a third but am very much in favor of bluetooth (for hands free calling only) and would consider backing with more funds with a perk.,over 1 year ago,"Thanks; Vincent; appreciate the suggestion. We had a few ideas for such a perk we were throwing out there internally; but haven't committed to them yet. THose ideas were for an external case; a bed-side or desk dock; to customized headphones with microphone for hands free talking.  We were hesitant to do so with so many unkowns to be determined still. If you have an suggestions; we'd love to hear them! Thanks again; Vincent! (we will try our best to include Bluetooth regardless FYI)

I think those are all good ideas. How about a bundle for all 3 in both color options for $50-$75? I bet a few current backers would support with that additional perk option and get you closer to the stretch goal. I certainly would.

Thanks for the super quick response! We will definitely be considering these options. We want to make sure we can guarantee their feasibility before promising and offering the perk; thanks for understanding."
Thats a lot just to get Bluetooth! I think you stretching way to much! :-(,over 1 year ago,Totally understand it feels like a huge stretch; and it is! It may be possible regardless of hitting the stretch goal and we will certainly explore. We simply cannot realistically guarantee that we can do it for any less. I.E. if in testing the addition of BlueTooth it becomes apparent that it will requires serious mechanical engineering changes than we could make those changes with the resources from  hitting the stretch goal.  Thanks for understanding!
"Suggestion: publish a well-defined rubric for accepting features based on a fixed set of goals:Goal: build the worlds least distracting phone.  Therefore: If a feature typically increases distraction IRL; it's out.Alarm clock: ok because it does not commonly lead to lower productivity IRL.  GPS: ok iff it can be put in a ""find my phone mode"" and does not allow any interaction from the phone itself.Texting: not ok - offer a software build without this.Don't please everyone; please!",over 1 year ago,"I like idea of a well-defined rubric. Although; as is apparent already in comments; there will always be gray areas with certain tools for different users. Texting being a super tricky one; in that one can argue for the utility (getting a PIN text for authentication from a bank's website for instance) or the potential abuse (arguing with your significant other via text for instance). Regardless; we don't want anyone's phone to have more features than they would like & texting can be turned off.

Hope that makes sense; and thanks for spending time with and supporting our project!"
I want some functions.1) Tetharing    I'm a delivery worker. Only Google Map cannot let go.2) Multiple band correspondence     This is the biggest reason why I use the iPhone. Because users are given the freedom to choose a telecommunications company.,over 1 year ago,Hello! 1. Tethering is something will explore and is still a possibility; but not something we can guarantee in the first shipment of the device. 2. We will try to squeeze as many bands in the phone as possible so it can be compatible with as many carriers in your region as possible because we don't want to force a certain telecommunications company on our users. There are some limitations with the size of our phone and amount of bands that can be efficiently inside the Light Phone 2. Best;Joe
Cant wait to get this phone in my hands and put my smart phone in the drawer. Phone calls; messaging; storage for some music and either earbud jack or Bluetooth and Im good! The less the better for me. I actually want to talk to people at dinner and during the day instead of staring at a screen. Love the size and concept. Thank you! I might get my life back. Closed my FB and Instagram accounts last year and my blood pressure is already better :),over 1 year ago,
I thought the whole point is to make this phone really stripped down. Phone; better battery; alarm clock--all super great. GPS--okay; useful. Weather--excellent idea. Water resistant--would be wonderful. But if the mission of Light is to add some peace and quiet and mindfulness to the world; adding an option that would allow for stuff like Bluetooth headsets corrupts that mission. This phone is a lock on the fridge so we don't sugar binge. Keep the candy away and stick to the original vision.,over 1 year ago,
I love the idea.  I don't have the willpower to resist my phone's temptations consistently; so I love the idea of removing them entirely.I live in the US; but travel abroad sometimes; and would love to take the Light Phone 2 with me; not only in order to enjoy the trips more; but also for increased privacy.  Would it be possible to make it a world phone instead of requiring buyers to select a band; and therefore a region in which the phone can operate?Thanks!,over 1 year ago,Hello! We completely understand your  point. We were hesitant to add more than 5 bands to each model per our current investigations with the tiny form factor we are afraid that adding more than 5 bands might cause interference. We will continue to explore all of our options for making the models as universal as possible and appreciate your understanding! Thanks.
"Just my initial thoughts.. keep things simple; that is the goal; right? I do not think I like the bluetooth idea as it might impact the battery life; something else that can break; additional cost; and then you may want to do more things that takes away from the ""soul"" of the project.",over 1 year ago,Thanks for that; Diego. I appreciate your point of view and agree that simple is definitely the goal. I want to assure that things like Bluetooth or potential other tools (software) down the road will not be considered if it would take away from that goal of keeping things simple and will always be optional. These points are very valid about making sure it does not effect battery life or durability in any way or most importantly drift away from the soul of the project.  Thanks!
Thank you so much for bringing this idea to life. You are the first campaign I ever contributed to.Reading through all the comments I love all the ideas/contributions people are bringing; but I think its important to stay true to the concept of stripping away everything and only keeping what is absolutely essential. I would love to have at least one Spotify playlist; but I feel like thats more entertainment than utility and ist part of what we want to sacrifice.,over 1 year ago,"Call and Sms is a must; even though; like many of my fellow germans; Whatsapp is what Sms has become for us; so for me that would be better; even though it may not be able to implement.   Alarms and Maps are important; maybe not only Home; but the ability to seach places (I usually know where home is). Maybe some form of public transport itinerary; though I understand thats hard to do (even for google maps); I think water resistance is important and

since its an e-inc screen and simple; maybe battery-life that lasts longer than an iPhone. Thanks for your passion and vision for this project!

Thank you so much for the support and for sharing your thoughts. We are honored to be your first campaign. One quick clarification that maybe isn't clear on the campaign; we did not intend Home to be the only option; more of an A to B search; we just sketched a few abstract ideas of what those apps might look like. Public transport would be wonderful if possible. Hope that all is well. Best;Joe"
Thank you so much for bringing this concept to market. It will be such a pleasure to not have my phone telling me what it thinks I should be doing! The maps/directions and the playlist options have my vote. Your pursuit of useful simplicity is inspiring.  Thanks again!,over 1 year ago,Thanks Laurie! Very excited to pursue useful simplicity with Light Phone 2 as well.
Light Phone Team;I happened upon The Light Phone as I was searching for a solution to rid me of the amount of attention I give to my iPhone. I signed up for the email list and not even a week later; I got the email announcing the Light Phone 2. I love the additions for the 2.If there were any other things that I know I use daily; it would be the ability to use Spotify and have Bluetooth. Maybe a partnership with them to bypass having to create an app store?,over 1 year ago,Hi Jackson! We are really going to try to get bluetooth into the device itself as we have also heard that from many users. Spotify would require a partnership to integrate if we felt it makes sense as a community to try and include. Cheers!
"Light Phone Team;What an elegant solution to this problem!I love this concept so much that I just made my very first backing on Indiegogo.-Things I'm greatly look forward to.-Turn by turn directions; with being able to search for locations.-Simple Music Player-Bluetooth connectivity so I can have turn by turn directions in my car.-Water Resistant/ProofSide Note: Lagom is a Swedish word meaning ""Just the right amount"".I feel like it's the spirit of this project.",over 1 year ago,"""Lagom"" . That's a great side note; thank you for sharing. I wrote that in my sketchbook. Honored to be your first Indiegogo campaign and can't wait to share the new Light Phone with you!"
Hi; I definitly love the concept; can't wait to have it.In addition to the basics features; the apps I would love to have are :- music (Spotify!)- map- whatsapp (most of my sms are not sms; but whatsapp messages)Great project; congrats,over 1 year ago,
"Nice idea. Fo me; the minimal ""apps"" I need are:- Phone and SMS- Contact and Calendar in Sync- Alarm/Reminder (maybe in Sync with Calendar)- Calculator;- Fluight-Mode;- Weather would be nice.- epub-Reader would be cool.- a nice Case would also be cool; too :-)Thank you!",over 1 year ago,
I'm very excited to be a part of this campaign. As I came upon this page on my laptop; I noticed that I was holding my smart phone in my other hand with the screen on; not even using it. Smart phones have almost-literally become an extension of our bodies. Looking forward to updates from the team in the coming months.,over 1 year ago,
Good luck on finishing the design of the phone. I'm looking forward to receiving them in April next year. You've definitely been inundated with requests. Hopefully; one more isn't too much. The Join App allows me to send texts; locate my phone and makes notes from my computer and appearing on my phone. Functionality like this will transfer the burden from my phone to a computer or a tablet.,over 1 year ago,
I love the concept and am looking forward to April 2019.  My suggestions are:- Please add the TMobile DIGITS app so that I can use it as a secondary phone- Love the e-ink screen and would like to be able to read books on it- Venmo; Maps; Uber; and music (spotify? I use it non-stop.  Or at least a radio so that I can find new songs) would all be great too,over 1 year ago,Thanks for the support Mark! We would love to be able to seamlessly integrate into TMobile Digits (and other similar programs from other carriers) as we think it will make the Light Phone 2 a very streamlined second phone; in a way that is only possible on such a carrier level like that.
Bluetooth would seem like a good tool for the people who drivedirections would be very useful; not sure how the screen will do that though eager to seewhat type of playlist are we talking about? streaming or something i use to upload? I would vote for the uploaded. calculator; weather; and ridesharing yes please; is a dictionary so much that you would have to pick?,over 1 year ago,
Access to the radio chip built into most phones could serve as a really valuable safety tool for NOAA and the like; please consider.,over 1 year ago,
I love everything that you guys have are going to add to this phone so far; like other people I think these features are also pretty essential:-Calculator-Weather-Reminders-It would be sweet if we could set up our Spotify account to this phone; as it is something I vastly use.I also know that while you guys do probably have the physical form of the phone figured out; I do think having some kind of LED flash on the back would be very helpful as a quick flashlight.,over 1 year ago,
Hi Light Phone team; it is time introduce stretch goal. The campaign is already a bit slowing down. We need to know where we need to go.. At least give the first and second stretch goal. IMHO,over 1 year ago,
So there are messaging function. Then; how about the keyboard? Would it be only possible to type latin characters for English or maybe other languages that would also need support for umlaut or other characters? Or would it be possible to type e.g. Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Russian/Arabic/Tamil?,over 1 year ago,
This sounds amazing; and thank you for getting this project going. I feel so strongly that this is the only way to maintain any reign on one's attention. Your features sound great. Please try to include:- maps-ride sharingThose would allow me to truly ditch the smartphone. Thank you!,over 1 year ago,
Hi great idea and great designs. I bought one and hope you all succeed. Im a programmer and I would love to build stripped down versions of smart phone apps. Do you guys plan to have a sdk where we could build out a customized app for the phone? Also a store or a platform to share my work with others would be awesome too. Thanks!,over 1 year ago,Hi Tomo;Thanks so much for the support! We originally did not foresee such an interest in the ability to allow users to custom build apps; and I can say that we are architecting the software in a way that will leave the possibility open for sure. Integration/interface-wise there is a lot TBD; but conceptually we'd like you to able to customize the phone to your needs.  Current framework we are planning to use is React Native if that is also helpful. Cheers! Joe
As I look at the screen on my iPhone; I cant help but thinking... Has your team considered a night filter? As in an orange tint that cuts down on the circadian-disturbing blue light coming from the backlight like the f.lux program? That could be a suitable substitute for inverting the text.,over 1 year ago,Hi David; I'm a huge fan of F.lux and have been personally using it for many years. Also as an iOS user NightMode was a welcomed new feature when it was introduced and I actually keep my smartphone permanently on that orange tint. It is definitely something we will consider; although; one really good conceptual point is that unlike a smartphone; hopefully you will not ever spend long periods of time staring at a Light Phone 2 :)
"Hi; I've tried and failed several time to go from iPhone to a flip phone and I always go back because I need maps.  I like that you guys are considering a navigation feature; but I don't quite get the home feature tbh.  Literally the only place I ever know how to get is home.  Perhaps consider having the ability to type in an address manually; or if that's too much; use a sort of ""peg"" system for travelers so I can mark current locations to come back to.",over 1 year ago,I'd also like to put in a vote for a calculator; weather; and ridesharing.  Playlists are a step away from utility and toward entertainment.
Excited x1000. I am a mom of 4 children under 7 yrs old and I am already struggling to stay present with all of them. They dive for my iphone. I hate it. My big issue will be lack of camera (canon g9x markII as wififriendly alternative?) For my work; teaching EC; I do often post photos to insty + fb for biz (of my babies on potties) + I do videos on fb live. I am thinking i'll revision what i'm doing there; + perhaps use the iphone as a posting tool ONLY during work hours; not 24/7. can't wait!,over 1 year ago,Ran out of room. Also I highly encourage spotify syncing. I play Raffi for my kids in the car to calm them down and have fun. And I have a Mighty (bemighty.com) that can sync to spotify and has no screen/iphone to drop during dancing. So; others are doing this and I think it's poss with a small screen...as an optional toolbox option of course! NEED my music but NOT my screen. <3 thank you!
Just wondering what the tally is on the features suggested by all the backers? Maybe at this time an online poll could be set up so we can all track what options are being suggested the most?,over 1 year ago,Hi Eric;We have done some internal tracking of requests; but do plan to do surveys to get more precise tallying of user interest as we also understand many backers have not commented or messaged us and want to include everyone's voice/opinions in such a tally. We are hesitant to do so too soon because more backers are coming everyday and might wait until the campaign ends to really dive into the surveys so that everyone is included. Does that makes sense? Open to suggestions of course!
I am really looking forward to the Light Phone 2. I dont know how I ended up on indiegogo after randomly floating through the internet forever; but I am glad I did. I support earlier comments about not having too many functions; because thats the reason we all came here in the first place - getting rid of stuff. Stay true to your idea; it is a great one!Call; messaging; alarm clock; contacts/calendar; maps.,over 1 year ago,Thanks Marie! Completely agree with simplicity. So glad our paths crossed; happy to have you as a backer!
"Hi and greetings from the UK :) Current proposed options are cool. In addition i'd love a really simple and minimalist Markdown Text Editor; which I could connect by Bluetooth to my TextBlade keyboard (when it finally arrives). I think would fit nicely with the .light ethos.Then possibly: E Reader;  although screen might be a bit too smallAudiobooksAwesome Battery lifePerhaps ""Get out of jail web browser"" something like the Kindles haveJustin",over 1 year ago,
Hi. Light phone 2 looking like my dream because oh the e-ink display!For me the features that I am looking for:1. Call2. Sms3. Simple To-do4. Calculator 5. Alarm6. Calendar&contacts with sync?7. Reading list like Pocket (e-ink; yes)8. Bigger battery And the last thing; maybe its possible to make this phone more travel friendly?Because I live in Israel; my brother in Singapore; part of family in USA; Russia; etc. So I really want this phone work around the world.,over 1 year ago,
The reason for more contacts is becouse of work& family. Having a good amount in there saved and only pick out the esentails on speed dial is prefect in my option. Becouse some people we need to keep in contact with becouse of many safety reasons and work contacts shoudn't be over them; espically since some people have more than one job therefore adding a more extensive contact list. But again this is just a suggestion if not this phone maybe a third gen? (20-25 contacts maybe),over 1 year ago,
"I suggest looking at Republic wireless's ""anywhere"" thing. Any how I donated a very small amount becouse I want to make sure I save to hopefully be able to get this phone. Also I have Project Fi so it's a bit different. The first generation of this phone was ok but basied off this light 2 phone  is looking like the perfect phone now even better with the e-ink display easy on my eyes and perfered! I so far see nothing wrong about it just hopeing for a long battery life and maybe more contacts.",over 1 year ago,
Backed with excitement- everything here is what I was looking for in a phone. Personal interests are:All basics already statedMaps (not necessarily directions; but just a map. Thats Light to me)Music MMS for speed and security- Signal has a platform thats really in line with Light; I think.  Memos- I forget pen and paper sometimesWeather CalendarI love Light and everything you guys are working for. This stuff matters a lot to me; and Im glad it matters a lot to you.,over 1 year ago,
Stoked about this; and the idea of adding a few more features to the Light Phone; while still keeping it from becoming a social media time burner. (Also really excited about the e-ink screen)For me the features that I am looking for:1. Call2. Text3. Rideshare4. Clock/Alarm5. Directions,over 1 year ago,
"Hey guys;I'm completely on board with idea of a minimalist alternative to a smart phone! Great idea. However; I know this one differs from the previous model in that it needs a separate SIM card? Does that mean we need to purchase a separate monthly call/text/data plan for it as well? If I use both ""smart"" and ""dumb"" devices; I'm afraid that may get rather pricey...",over 1 year ago,Hey Alex! Thanks for spending time with our project. Both the original and new Light Phone require a SIM actually. We were able to offer a simple; limited voice only plan for the previous Light Phone for $5 a month and hope to have a few options for the new phone as well (will be sharing details for interested users well before shipping in the coming months). You could also go to your existing provider and get an additional line; usually much cheaper than a separate plan. Hope that makes sense!
Hi folks!Myself and my partner are so pumped about this phone! I want to do away with my smartphone altogether.Here's my two cents on features:Call; Message; Alarm; Contacts; Directions; Weather and Music (limited capacity is fine).Besides this; I want to add another voice to the chorus calling for google voice integration. I am an insurance broker and I've built my business around my google voice VOIP number. Outbound calls with that number would be super appreciated.Thanks!Elliot,over 1 year ago,"HI Elliot! I am less familiar with Google Voice. Does your current smartphone use your Google Voice number? If yes; is a SIM with that specific number? Thanks; would love to make it as seamless of a solution as possible for everyone within our capabilities (sometimes there are limitations from various carriers or smartphone devices). Cheers; Joe

I am honestly not the most tech savvy person; so please accept that caveat. It allows me to disguise my cell # as a different number. When people call my google voice number; it rings on my Verizon cell number. When I make a call from my cell phone; it gives me the option to dial with my regular cell number or my google voice number. It's really great for someone that wants to separate their business and personal numbers. Not to mention that it's been on my business cards for 3 years.Thanks!

Likewise for myself. That sounds awesome; we are looking into it now and at a high level it doesn't seem impossible for us to find a similar integration. Thanks for sharing this information; it was super helpful. Wishing you a wonderful weekend!"
"I love the project and hope you guys stay with the minimal concept and don't add too many features. CallMessageAlarmContactsCalculatorPlaylist (maybe; not a deal breaker either way but it'd be nice)I don't think you need all the other ""features"" in my opinion. That's the whole point of going light.",over 1 year ago,"Hi Sam; You nailed it. These are the features (playlist as a maybe) that are most definitely going to be in phone. I agree with this selection and would have a similar configuration even if other tools are available. I think even something like directions is really empowering when you learn to get around with out it. I like to look things up before hand and make a little sketch if I think I really need it... it isn't maybe as easy and it might take longer; but  it's a more satisfying experience.

Thank you for the support; can't wait to share the Light Phone with you. Cheers; Joe"
Super excited about this! Since I backed it I've been thinking of how I'd see it working well in my workflow. Right now I have my personal cell and a Google Voice number for work that goes to that same cell.I don't mind having to pay for another sim/line with my provider - but it would be ideal/great if I could use that Google Voice number with Light Phone - not just forwarding; but also being able to call using that number so I don't have to give everyone a new # again. Just my 2 cents!,over 1 year ago,Totally see where you are coming from with wanting to use that number. I'm not sure it's possible to mask outgoing calls/messages from the Light Phone as another number within our control on the device side; but you might be able to port that Google Voice number to a SIM that would work in the Light Phone perhaps?  Best; Joe
"Excited to be a part of this.  Love the idea of ""essential apps"" only.  Rough importance:1. Call2. Text - include method to forward MMS/picture messages to email for viewing later?3. Contacts - integrate with google for easy management4. Alarm / Clock / Timer / Stopwatch5. Calculator6. Rideshare - I can call a ride to anywhere from home.  Just need to call a ride home from wherever I am.7. Music - only enough for a run; gym; or drive8. Directions/Maps - Maybe.",over 1 year ago,Really interesting thought re:MMS/picture messages forwarding to email; appreciate you sharing that idea!
I don't feel that a Ride Sharing app is going 'light'. Calling a cab would be going light. That being said; if the phone has Google Now I think you can order an Uber if your account is linked.,over 1 year ago,"Reading down; I see you're not keep on that level of Voice assistant as it will support the big tech companies. That makes sense but it might also be the difference between selling tens of thousands units vs. millions. Probably (sadly) jack the price point too.

Hi Oli; thanks for the support! To be clear; we are not 100% against it; but our gut feeling so far is that it feels too far away from the philosophy of the Light Phone. Ride-sharing app would only be integrated if it were possible to do so in a way that felt truly 'light'. Also; want to make sure it's clear that any potential feature is optional; including messaging; we want the phone to have exactly the tools you need and nothing else. Hope this makes sense; thanks again!"
Cant wait to see it reach the 1M mark which I think will happen soon. All fingers crossed. Please bring this to life. Coz itll bring our lives back.. ;-),over 1 year ago,:)
Funny the different ideas of 'light'.  For me it is 'lighter' not to be involved with cloud or social media apps; so Spotify is 'heavier' than MP3s; but I get how having to maintain files is 'heavier' for some.Re: WhatsApp over SMS messaging - don't wanna pay inflated data prices to send a msg thru the phone network; but many don't want to have to  install extra stuff to reproduce the basic function of SMS.,over 1 year ago,"Love the minimal design; but am a bit nervous about which features it will have...  I asked re: 3rd party devs in earlier comment as it would mean that if all else failed I could just write my own.(Man the comment length limit here is very frugal!)

Hi Greg;Minor update re:3rd part devs; was working with software team yesterday and we are architecting things in a way that it should be possible to allow you to write your own 'tools' (I believe the framework we intend to use is React Native). We didn't get to the details of how that would work from an interface standpoint; but at a high level we are working in a way to leave the option available and will be polling our backers for interest when the campaign ends. Cheers!

Hey Joe!  Great news!  Plenty of details to be worked out yet; no doubt; but I'm glad to see that this is being considered at least."
One question though?I see three different models for different basebands across regions; for a traveler;  will there be a model that covers most basebands? across different countries,over 1 year ago,Hi Rakesh;It may be possible to offer such a phone; but we conservatively limited each model to 5 bands due to the small form factor. In going through testing we may find that it is possible to squeeze more bands into the device without effecting the efficiency. Such a phone to cover all countries would most likely require addition space (thickness) and that would mean we'd need to re-engineer the phone with a whole new layout and make additional tooling which would almost double R&D costs.
Looks great; only must have request from me would be Whatsapp;  It is go to encrypted messaging service; for contacting my close friends and family; But I guess it would need to work with the whatsapp team to get it working on the phone.Uber is a big if possible; but i guess the primary challenge in this case (whatsapp too); would be porting to eink display,over 1 year ago,Hi Rakesh; Yes both Uber or Whatsapp integrations would require some participation with their teams as you predict. Having launched the campaign; we are already starting to explore their interest in helping support development on Light Phone 2 to understand feasibility and what an integration might look like; if we decide it makes sense to do so of course.
I must say; Im really excited by your project. Ive often felt that smartphones are more complicated than they need to be; and I also have executive functioning issues; so Ive definitely experienced it as a problem worthy of fixing. In brief; here are some features I use every day:- Transit directions- To-do list/calendar- Notes- Weather- Flashlight- Calculator (especially a tip calculator)- Airplane modeThese would be enough perhaps to get me to make the switch some of the time...,over 1 year ago,... but in order to be my daily driver; it would need:- Email- Speech-to-text- Voice recorder- Tethering- Expanded messaging (preferably with the option of FB Messenger; only because it's so common)- Wifi calling- Music streaming- Bluetooth- E-reader (epub; mobi/azw; pdf)- Skype/Hangouts- Online payments (including Interac)Nice-to-haves would include a health tracker (see https://www.apple.com/ios/health/); Bilingual keyboard support (two languages at once); and Google Translate :)
Voice: What are you envisioning for voice? Like connection with Google; or Alex services for quick questions? This would solve weather; directions; calculator; and dictionary! In the end I'd say direction; and playlist are the two that would make it possible for the phone to be a primary device for me.,over 1 year ago,"Voice in theory could connect to something like those you mention; but I'm not sure we intend to ever introduce such an integration. We were thinking more like voice commands to navigate the Light Phone 2 easier - ""call mom""; ""set alarm for.."" ""message ..."" "" new contact""... etc. We will definitely keep our ears open the needs of everyone; but at the moment such a voice assistant feels like we'd be supporting by the very tech monopolies we want to get away from with the Light Phone 2."
Alarm: Simple but an important basic feature.Auto-reply: Are you thinking when in a certain mode this is enabled?Directions: Is an important one that would let this be a primary phoneRide-sharing: Would be useful for many I'm sure.Playlist: I'd request some sort of podcast syncing. (Even a few goes a long way for a commute) Consider reaching out to the Pocketcast folks. I'm sure they'd work with you to integrate.Weather: basic info is good! just no notifications please,over 1 year ago,Re: Auto-reply: Sort of thought so yeah; like how you might turn on airplane mode; you could turn on auto-reply for messages (maybe calls too?). Thanks for suggestion of Pocketcast; noted. Totally agree regarding weather notifications (in general notifications we hope to make as sparingly as possibly if at all;).
You definitely have the right idea as far as features go. Call: no feedback. I like what I see. With contact integration I hope it will look-up and reference.Message: love the simplicity of this. How are you handling notifications for texts? Or is that something that would only show up in Recent?Contacts: I really hope that contact sync will be possible somehow. Google? Apple? Fits with the whole second phone concept.,over 1 year ago,HI Brian;Thanks for the feedback! We still have to flush out notifications fully; and have ideas we want to share with everyone once the campaign ends and we go into development. Recents is one idea for a stream of both recent calls and messages (good eye seeing that). Syncing contacts we want to make as easy as possible and we will be asking about how everyone currently stores their contacts so we can try our best to have a super simple solution for everyone.
I have a question about the messaging feature for the phone.  with this support just text messaging or might this support messaging apps like Whatup App?,over 1 year ago,
Great idea!Please make calendar and contacts support WebDAV/CalDAV/CardDAV standards; or related open standards for syncing. In this way I can then use computer to manage contacts and calendar; while phone would just display the information in a simple way.I would like to suggest you still include a camera; but without any display. You make a photo and you look later what you got. Like we were used to. Like: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ondu-/ondu-pinhole-cameras,over 1 year ago,
300%!!,over 1 year ago,It's amazing!!
I think this is solid as is; the one thing that does pop into mind is having good haptics. If poor vibration; it makes the phone experience less; by being super loud without actually being felt. But with HD haptics; it would really complement the design of minimalist phone.,over 1 year ago,Josean; Thank you. I definitely agree. We had a pretty decent haptics feedback in the original Light Phone and users seem to really like it. We will assess the performance of the same component on Light Phone 2 and potentially look into different vibration motors if needed. kai
This is AWESOME!Here are the features I'd like to see:1. call2. messaging3. contacts4. clock/alarm5. lyft/uber6. navigation7. kindle/e-reader8. music9. bluetooth for car/headphones10. calendar11. calculator12. email (maybe?)13. wifi,over 1 year ago,
Thinking of my personal Light 2; here is what I think should be integrated in the phone. Nothing more.. Nothing less..1.Call2.Phonebook3.Messaging4.Dictionary5.Navigation6.Calculator7.Compass8.Torch9.Music + radio10.Settings,over 1 year ago,
"I love this so much; ordered one. Call; text; notes and maybe email is all I need haha.One thing (more of a total wish; though most likely won't happen): this device would be perfect for a barebones ""pay for what you use"" type plan like Google Fi offers - though they currently only let you bring certain phones. What a match that would be. Keep up the great work gents!",over 1 year ago,Thanks Matt! We didn't want to make our campaign more complex than it had to be by adding about our service plan ideas; but we do plan to even offer our own perfectly tailored plans for the Light Phone 2 because of its limited feature set. We'll be sharing much more of those details in the coming months prior to shipping for users interested in such a service. We would also love to become a compatible device with Google Fi; giving the user as many options as possible for the Light Phone 2.
Light 2 may not be smart but it is still at the cutting edge; by matching technology to user requirements. I would like to see it have Google Now  - making it a portable Google Home. That would add a lot of functionality (music; navigation; wikipedia) without the screen addiction aspect but understand that other may not want this.Incredibly excited to have two of these on order. I have 3 young kids children & don't want them to think staring at screens in social settings is normal. Choose life!,over 1 year ago,
Hi Joe ~ Did you mean to say the screen would be lit as opposed to backlit? I think e-ink requires front lighting with a diffusion layer. Do you believe the phone face will be seamless as pictured?,over 1 year ago,Correct! You are right about the screen lighting; my mistake.  We will try our best to thoroughly work on that aspect of the design (and have a few ideas with learnings from our last phone) to make it as seamless as possible; but it cannot be 100% seamless unfortunately. When lit that seam will be more visible than when it is not being lit. I do really think with our design sensibilities we can achieve a much more seamless screen relative to other devices with E-Ink that might be used to.
How about memory for music ?,over 1 year ago,Not a ton of memory; honestly; I think it's spec'd at 1GB currently for all of the phone. However; this was never intended to be a music device if that makes sense; we simply thought that a playlist of music (in my case probably some jazz or ambient music) might help me focus when writing; drawing ; brainstorming.  I hope this does not come as a huge disappointment; I just want to be honest about the phone's main objective of being a tool for 'going light'.
I'm truly looking forward for this! But one thing I really hope for is internationell keyboards for texting; especially Swedish with the possibilities to write ;  and  :-) Otherwise; I'm fine with just talk; text and time!,over 1 year ago,Thanks for that point up Niklas. That seems feasible enough; and I also hope that we can easily add support for international keyboards as well. We really appreciate your backing of our project!
Honestly never realised that there are people out there; like myself; who are fed up of app slavery and the boredom it creates. A big shout out to the light group for bringing this. We go back to the world.. Finally!,over 1 year ago,Yeah!! :)
I hope to be able to display Japanese on Light Phone 2.It is even better to be able to input Japanese.,over 1 year ago,Hello! Currently we were only planning to provide the phone in English; with the hopes to expand our international language support in time.  We will need to investigate what it will take to provide support for Japanese or other languages which we do not yet know. Thank you for understanding.
I am SO excited for this phone. I love the e-ink. I love the potential music function (I like downloaded playlists); maps; and simple messaging and calls; I love the size.I think my suggestions/questions would be- will group messaging be available? Will this be wifi capable? And will (text) messaging over wifi be available? That was the one major thing I missed about my merged google hangouts/messaging on android-- if I was on wifi; even if it was on airplane mode; I could still receive texts.,over 1 year ago,Hello! Thank you so much for the support :) I understand where you are coming from with group messaging. We do not yet have a fully flushed out answer but realize that group texting is something many of our users will encounter. We do aspire a way to text over wifi (the phone does have a wifi antenna) however we also do not know the details about how this will work yet and will be sharing our options with our backers as we go through the development phase over the coming months. Cheers!
Love the concept of this phone. I have been searching for this type of phone for a while now; glad to contribute to it! From reading most of the comment responses I have faith you guys will not only stay true to your vision but incorporate consumer ideas to the best of your abilities. Thanks again guys!,over 1 year ago,We are honored to have you as a backer; Luis; and really appreciate your kind understanding of the situation and our goals. Very well said. Best; Joe
So it seems to me that a lot of comments here are asking for a ton of features. Isnt that contrary to the spirit of this whole thing? I want this phone because its aesthetically pleasing while offering basic functionality. It seems like including a ton of features would make this just a smart phone thats also a good conversation starter. Please; keep the phone simple. I really want a phone that Ill never need to look at.,over 1 year ago,Hi Sean; We love your concerns actually; and promise that our goal is to deliver a truly simple phone.  Part of the goal of the Light Phone; including our initial phone; was to challenge the idea that we NEED these apps that we have convinced ourselves we cannot live without. When actually without them we find our selves empowered by the fact that we still get by. Any potential features would be optional; and you will always have full control to keep your Light Phone 2 as simple as you want.
This is awesome. Congrats guys and gals on a great product. In reading the comments; it came to me that versatility in what apps (for want of a better word) is something that backers are valuing. Perhaps a browser-based sandbox filled with various items eg. GPS; uber whats app messinging; calculator; notes; MP3 player; Bluetooth etc. would allow individual owners to customise their lightphone to suit. Plug the phone into a computer; drag and drop the items you want; and presto: everybody happy.,over 1 year ago,"Hi Edward; Yes it is interesting to see how the few ""essential tools"" vary greatly amongst users. It does seem that a few tools would be enough; but those tools vary. We are internally calling it a ""customized toolbox"" in which we have always imagined the user could pick which features they wanted to add to their very simple phone experience. It won't be an ""app store"" by any means; but customization will be key to keeping the phone super simple and suitable for everyone it appears."
I only have a couple of requests for this device; beyond what's already planned above:- E2E encrypted messaging. I'd work with the Signal Foundation (https://signal.org/) to bring the Signal protocol to your messaging.- Bluetooth. Not just for headphones; but also for connection to something like a goTenna (https://gotenna.com/). Maybe a separate app for messaging through a goTenna mesh network?That's all from me for now. Looking forward to trying it out!,over 1 year ago,Those are great points. GoTenna is awesome too; and I see your point exactly. I also use Signal with many of my friends and enjoy the encryption a lot. We would love to open up a conversation with them to see if that might be possible to do while not changing the 'light' experience. Hope that all is well; Derek; and thanks a ton for the support!
Just ordered a phone; exciting! So my top suggestion would be a hotspot function and second to that; a simple b&w map interface; maybe just locked to where you are with zoom in/out; looking kind of like this perhaps.. https://snazzymaps.com/style/79/black-and-white That's it; I obviously love the keep it light concept.,over 1 year ago,Hello! Thanks for ordering a phone; very excited to share the Light Phone 2 with you. Hot spot is definitely something we are hearing from a lot of backers and look forward to exploring.  Thanks for also sharing that map. We initially stuck with just text based directions because it seemed like the easiest to implement and we feared the small screen would make a map difficult to understand; but we will definitely be exploring that much further over the next couple of months. This is interesting!
This looks like a really nice product; and concept !features that would be nice- no ports (qi wireless charging)- bluetooth (mostly for music with headphones)- Hotspot- e-reader / kindle - improved messaging (whatsapp?) would be a great addition but i understand it is not the main purpose.- alarm clock / timer / stopwatch / calculator- read only calendar view will the screen be backlighted like kindle paperwhite ?,over 1 year ago,"sorry; just saw a comment that it would have a front light after posting :)

All of these are interesting features and we appreciate you sharing them with us :) Yes; as you noted; the screen will have a backlight so that it is visible in dark; we should make that more clear on the campaign page."
"considerations:  (I have the 1st gen)I'd use it more if it were:*waterproof (I ride & want to put it on my bars for GPS)*GPS as low tech as my e-ink pebble watch with ""NavMe""  - an arrow; dist & st name - https://goo.gl/eJQ1Nn*B.T. for a safer convo in a car **--  through connected devices; FWD can be auto enabled when devices get to far from each other - via automation (e.g. tasker)*wireless charging removes ports that can break or get gummed up**aids in waterproofing",over 1 year ago,"- a prgrm ""app"" for the S.P.

Thanks for sharing this feedback! Waterproof is something we are really aiming for; but were hesitant to include in that campaign at this stage of development and were hoping it would be a ""pleasant surprise"" for our backers if we can pull it off. Great example of GPS; will explore more; thanks! Bluetooth is something we are diving into the past few days as we have heard a lot of requests; we hope that it will be possible. We are still a little concerned about universal compatibility for B.T.

... because some users have explained that their Bluetooth devices require a smartphone app for syncing. But for now; we are trying to tackle the hardware challenge of squeezing it in; and so far it seems that it will be possible. We are considering Bluetooth addition as a stretch goal idea; but want to make sure we can 100% pull it off before announcing that. Thanks again for the great feedback!"
I noticed that the dimensions are larger than the ORG... (lightphone = credit card HxW and 4cc thick).  Why is the new one bigger? -- *would love to keep it the same HxW at min.*I really appreciate that I can hide it behind my card or license and it not be seen or flip my cards under it and because (mine is black) it's basically a void/more secure than just seeing those items sitting on the table next to you. The ORG size adds security through lack of visibility.,over 1 year ago,Hello! Thanks for being an original Light Phone supporter as well :) You are correct the phone did get a little longer. I believe (sorry for my less than expert technical understanding) we had to do that for packing in the 4G antennas and bands that we wanted. It is the same width still and feels very similar in the hand. It still fits in the pockets we tested (like yoga pants with a small card pocket). I agree that I wish we could keep the exact same HxW dimensions; but it may not be possible.
First of all; thanks for bringing this concept to life.  I'm bummed I missed the Light Phone I; but am excited for the arrival of this device.  I did have one suggestion that I wanted to share regarding the SIM card.  As I understand it; we won't be able to forward calls/texts to this device; so it will require it's own SIM card.  To the extent possible; can we make the process for inserting/removing as easy as possible?  I'd like to keep my current phone and just swap in and out as needed.,over 1 year ago,"Hi Jordan; That is a great point about a simple and durable mechanism for inserting and removing the SIM. Swapping SIM would make it the most seamless of an extension of your phone; however forwarding calls is still possible if you got a second SIM for your Light Phone 2. Message forwarding unfortunately is not something that it appears any carrier offers aside from those starting their ""multiple device; same number"" platforms (i.e. T-Mobile Digits or ATT Number Sync). Hope that makes sense!"
I'm really happy to see you guys are making a sequel to the Light Phone. It's a really important idea; and I think it's an important part of a bigger movement to use technology responsibly.I don't think it should have any music capabilities or Spotify partnership. Music is great but I don't think it fits with the brand message of disconnecting and quieting your mind. A lot of people use music as a crutch instead of enjoying the silence. Also; weather is probably not necessary. Just go outside.,over 1 year ago,"I completely see where you are coming from. Initially our intentions with music were to offer a simple playlist (for me it'd be some Brian Eno or Steve Reich) that help me when I'm writing; but we definitely never saw the phone as full fledged music device by any means. If a music tool does come to be an option; I can at least assure you that it will be just that; optional. The phone will be customizable to your needs without us ever forcing other functions upon you.

Great points."
"With an e-ink display; I believe the white model will be far more legible and less strenuous on the eyes (https://goo.gl/BzEpHG). There is a reason you can't buy a Kindle Paperblack. It's going to be hard waiting for this phone in an instant gratification world! I plan to use Project Fi and use my Light phone as primary and put the free data only SIM in my smart phone for use in my car. Keep up the great work and keep it ""light""!",over 1 year ago,Hi Bradley! Hope that all is well. Hehe; it is going to be a long year as we are just as eager to share this phone with everyone. I love how you are already thinking about integration into your lifestyle; there will be a lot of options for our users and we hope to help everyone find a suitable situation that makes sense for them. Very excited! Cheers; Joe
if you want to make this waterproof (fully enclosed); add a Bluetooth radio and wireless charging.  Sound from the speaker should come through a waterproof membrane fine if placed near the ear; otherwise using a Bluetooth headset and wireless charging mean no ports.I would LOVE to see this built like a solid piece of material (don't care the material); with no holes in it!  :D  It'd really serve it's purpose and feel SO futuristic.  There'd be no device like it; until copy cats come along.,over 1 year ago,Wow; that would be a pretty spectacular device. I know Kai is really excited about trying to make the phone waterproof and has a lot of ideas. We just didn't want to promise it on the campaign yet; until we were fully sure that it was possible; but we think that would make so much sense for a phone like this. Thanks for sharing your vision with us!
"My wife and I are so excited about the Light Phone 2. Our thoughts on optional features. 1) Fancier texting. It would be helpful to see the emoji's; pics; etc. 2) Directions. Ideally we would like to be able to search for locations while on the go. Though we realize this may start to blur the line of this devices purpose which we respect. 3) It wasn't on your list. The possibility to ""hot spot"" would be incredibly useful to us. Thanks for the truly helpful innovation! Peace.",over 1 year ago,"4) Weather. We're pretty disconnected anyway and having a little forecast would be great.

Hi Jordan; Thanks for spending time with our project and for supporting! Eager to share the Light Phone 2 with you both. Hotspot and weather are interesting and we have been hearing from a lot of users. Hotspot if done in a very simple non intrusive way; could make it easy to ditch the smartphone for good in swaps for a more suitable device like a small computer or tablet for email or research while traveling; giving you the peace of mind that when you close that computer you close the inbox too

We never planned to add emoji or images to the message experience; but have definitely thought about a list of customizable preset messages for many common uses. Perhaps a simplified icon system might makes sense; but I'm very hesitant to say emoji. I would love to get more feedback regarding that from our backers. Thanks again for sharing your thoughts!

Thanks for the reply Joe. We currently use basic phones; mine (LG Exalt LTE with Verizon) offers a 4G hotspot and we will occasionally use it as you describe. Close the laptop and done. Pertaining to the icon/emoji topic. Our issue is particularly seeing what is coming from others. Being able to receive/send group texts and see an image that is sent would be helpful. Right now basic phones are making it difficult to connect with others. Being able to send a quick little icon could be nice.

That does make sense; especially in being able to see what other send. We will definitely be taking that into consideration. Appreciate it!"
I had version 1 and really loved it. Looking forward to V2 with eInk display (best thing you could have done) and the addition of SMS messaging. I hope it is a very simple SMS tool - no bells; no whistles; no mainstream. Though I would love if it supports multiple contacts in a message stream; as many of my conversations are with 2+ people at a time. The only other thing on my wish-list is simple test directions. This would cover all my needs in a phone: Calls; texts; alarm; and directions.,over 1 year ago,"*that should have read text directions - like you show in your video.

Hi Ray; How's it going? Thanks for the continued support! We really listened to our original users when working on this next iteration; glad to hear you agree that e-ink is a great display for this phone. Group texting is something we acknowledge is a big part of texting for many; and will need to be addressed somehow. We have a few ideas but have not flushed that aspect out fully. I also want to make sure it's clear that your phone can be limited to those 4 features (it's customizable).

Awesome news Joe; thanks! (Love that it can be customized to those functions too!)"
Love this phone. Exactly what I've been looking for IF we could get to connect Spotify. The hardest part of scrapping the smart phone for me has been navigation and spotify. I know its difficult to promote one streaming service; but for those that don't already have spotify they offer free accounts. Such a cool idea and a beautiful design. Regardless; I'll be getting one.,over 1 year ago,Hi Jonathan;So glad you found our phone! Those two features are very commonly cited as reasons for not fully ditching a smartphone for our users which is why we are considering them now. Although it very well may be possible add Spotify; we do not yet see this as the best possible music playing device. I worry that the full experience of Spotify (searching; etc.) may be compromised by the small screen. Our 'music tool' might be limited to syncing one playlist from your Spotify for example.
Call: Check.. Alarm: Check.. Text: This is whats confusing me. Will it be normal text messaging? Can we do some kind of integration where we can have services like telegram or jabber for chatting. The place where i live; people hardly use text messages; they'd rather end up using WhatsApp or BBM in that case. So how can this be solved? If so; please clarify.,over 1 year ago,"Hi Ali;Thank so much for your interest and support and sorry that we have not been more clear around exact functionality of messaging. Initially we can guarantee basic normal SMS text messaging. Other platform integration as you mention is something many users are asking about and we are open to exploring the possibility of such integrations; however it is too early to promise any specific integration will be possible just yet. I'll add that it does seem possible at a high level.

Thanks Joe. See what fits best. I am definitely not a fan of useless apps so this is a PERFECT phone I am looking forward to get. Cheers!"
Huge fan of Light and have had my eye on you since the first Light phone. As one who works in the mobile industry; daily I tout and train about features of devices in order to sell more product. But who I am as a person; Light 2 is a near perfect reflection of who I want to be. I want my phone to be my tool and control it; not the other way around. That said; this vision of what a phone can be excites me beyond words. To top it off; even the design is gorgeous and thoughtful.,over 1 year ago,"One thing I am concerned about however; is updates on the device. It will run a modified version of Android; but what of updates to the software not only for improvements; but for security? Will they be installed over the air? How long will the software be sustained? Many Android devices nowadays may only see 1 or 2 version bumps. What of Light 2?Thank you for addressing my concerns. Keep those updates coming! I am excitedly looking forward to them.

Christopher; so glad to have you as a backer. Couldn't agree more about wanting my phone to be a tool that I control; and that is exactly our goal here. As for software updates; one reason we have moved to 4G is to support wireless updates. We see a really long roadmap of software updates for this device and have no intentions of making this device obsolete. One way we plan to support (financially) our continued long term development effort is to offer a variety of service plans through Light;"
Hi! I really like the concept and design of the phone. Id really like to see bluetooth; music streaming; waterproofing and USB-C. Whatsapp would be a great addition to make the phones messaging function more usable.,over 1 year ago,Great feedback; thanks for taking the time to share and hope you enjoyed a wonderful weekend :) Best; Joe
a simple list. not even with checkboxes. up down nav -oneline entry; exist or not. the right kind of basic list. any merit?,over 1 year ago,Definitely interesting sounding to me; thanks for sharing Wade. We will be synthesizing all of the feedback and preparing some surveys for when the campaign ends to share with everyone.
Definitely hope you include a way to stream music on the phone! Road trip to the mountains with my favorite tunes over the car stereo and my email and apps left at home sounds perfect.,over 1 year ago,"Sounds like a perfect use case to me; David. Our concern with music right now is whether it will make more sense to partner with streaming services or to limit it to adding songs the user owns; like a mp3. We don't want to force a streaming partner on our users; but are aware that many users do not actually own much music anymore. It'll be interesting to survey our users more about this once the campaign finishes.

Totally get not wanting to force a certain streaming service; but the idea of rebuying music and loading mp3s over a cable takes me back to 2002 in all  the wrong ways. Looking forward to giving feedback as the development goes forward!

Really like the idea of just having 3 linked Spotify playlists. Curate at home and just press play when on the go!

That's sort of exactly how we imagined it (also personally a Spotify user and Spotify happens to be pretty open to such collaborations in the past). Also because the form factor of the phone is so small; it makes more sense to curate at home and just play when with the Light Phone 2."
Will the OS support other languages?,over 1 year ago,"Robert; OS is English only for now but depends on the demand/orders from different region. We'd consider the possibility to support other language. Hope this make sense. kai

Absolutely. I was asking to get an understanding if the keyboard will support multiple languages or not. Would be a nice feature; but not a deal breaker as I am 100% on-board with the concept and am ecstatic that you have surpassed the goal.Since you far exceeded the original goal do you guys have an idea of what areas the extra money may be used to better support the project?"
Im wondering about the color choice as well. Will we be able to change our mind on black or white until production begins? I checked the box for the black model; but Im hesitant to commit to one or the other without more pictures/footage of the models in different lighting conditions etc.,over 1 year ago,David; thank you for the support. Our team will be sending out survey and confirm your color and model choices before we start shipping. Hope this helped. kai
I'm excited that you guys are making this product. I think efforts such as this will help free up our attention. I switched to basic phone about 3 months ago and have been experiencing a lot more mental bandwidth; which I can use to better reflect on my own life and what's happening in the world. As a pediatrician; I have been noticing more and more kids/teenagers whose dependency on their phones really borders on; or already is; addiction. Looking forward to this product; keep up the good work!,over 1 year ago,Calvin; we are really excited too! Being more connected just couldn't possibly make us any happier. We believe technology should help us getting things done; not enslave us. We already have so much beautiful things  in our life. cheers; kai
How does the screen work in low light/night? E-ink displays are known to be terrible in those conditions unless they incorporate a backlight like a kindle paperwhite,over 1 year ago,Gabriel; we are planning to add front lighting to our eink module. cheers kai
I believe adding music streaming such as Spotify; which according to Business Insider is one of the most streamed music services; would be a major asset to this phone. Since the release of such streaming services; I haven't purchased music in years. I would hate to have to go back to that when using this phone. It would require a lot more work and impede the process of going light.With the addition of Spotify; I would 100% purchase this phone for me and my family. Thank you!,over 1 year ago,Thanks for the feedback Alexia. I also use Spotify for a lot of my music needs these days too (still love records of course!). We love the idea of a collaboration like that and are aware that many others may be in your exact situation (not owning music these days); but are also aware that not everyone uses Spotify either.  We will be talking with everyone after the campaign closes to get feedback on the various options for our different 'tool' ideas. Again; thanks for the support!
I would love to see Bluetooth; maps with navigation; Uber; waterproofing of some sort; and the option of a case to add.,over 1 year ago,
I am puzzled by many comments. All have great intentions but for a lot they are going against the nature of this project. minimalist and focusing on other things than technology; this is what this phone is all about. so please; make sure to keep it as minimal as possible. The idea to open a repository to create and to make some apps available is definitely not something I would encourage. call; sms; alarm and direction are way enough. keep it light !,over 1 year ago,"Thanks for the support Pascal. You are completely right; focusing on other things than technology is exactly what this phone is all about.  The goal is still as minimal as possible and we don't have plans for anything like an ""app store"". I'll add that we want users to have full control of the phone; some of our initial Light Phone users still do not want messaging and love the idea of being able to leave a permanent auto-response saying something like; ""I don't receive messages; please call.""

Basically I want to say your phone can definitely be limited to call; sms; alarm and direction without ever worrying about us trying to get you to add unwanted features. Our desire to have a few more features available to users that might find them super useful is that hopefully that will allow them the freedom to leave their smartphone much more often or for good. But we never intend to compete with smartphones in terms of features by any means. This is a very simple; minimal phone. Cheers!"
I see that it is to be Android-based; will it be possible for developers to build their own apps for this device?  This really breaks down to 2 questions: 1 - do you intend to provide libraries and info to make it easier to develop for this device and 2 - if not; do you intend to try to prevent developers from finding their own ways to develop apps for it?Loving the design!,over 1 year ago,"Greg; thank you. To be completely honest with you; we haven't thought about open platform. We are collaborating with a group software team from both Eink and our device manufacturer. I can definitely see the benefits of collective intelligence from our backers and community. We will keep this in mind and will let you know if we have any updates regarding your questions. I apologize for my vague answers. kai

Hi Kai!Yeah; I understand that it is early days yet; and that there are partners involved in producing bits of the software; so it sounds like it is unlikely to be an open platform; at least at first.Re: my second question - if people start hacking on this device to root it or add their own software; will you guys try to prevent this through legal means?"
Will there be a rugged case; i work dirt; im simple;  need simple phone; need to know itll have basic protection!!,over 1 year ago,"Wade; thank you. The intention is to make Light II fairly durable and waterproof so there is no need for case. We are at the moment have no plan to make Light II case but this is something we might be able to offer as a stretch goal down the road. cheers; kai

I'd pay for one...when might stretch goals be part of the campaign??

We are exploring a few ideas currently and hope to have one out next week. One idea is guaranteeing Bluetooth as we have seen a lot of requests for that; but want to make sure we understand what we would need to execute that before setting that goal. Thanks for the feedback regarding a case; if not a stretch goal it is certainly something we will be considering; along with a dock idea as well. Cheers!"
Hello from France !Great Idea ! Fews ideas : i wish the phone can be able to stream podcast; have a  plane mode; don't be afraid of water and have a camera (NOT FOR SELFIES; just great moment in your life). Thks for your job!,over 1 year ago,
Direct sim card connection without forwarding from smart phone would be great. Also multiple language keyboard. I use google map for bus schedules and directions so having such function on this phone can be helpful too.,over 1 year ago,
Please consider bluetooth for wireless connections (headphone and car).,over 1 year ago,
Just contributed to the White model. It shows my inner personality in a lot of ways. Thanks for such a project. Simple; minimalistic and less.. drama. Cant wait to have it.But do you ship in the UAE? Since its not mentioned in the B section for shipping areas worldwide. Can you clarify on this!?,over 1 year ago,
Looks great. But please add Bluetooth! I would like for it to connect to my car for calls or Bluetooth headphones. Congrats on the quick funding.,over 1 year ago,
Forgot to ask; what's the possibility of a Notes feature? Nothing fancy. I use that feature fairly often and feel like it'd be nice to add so that you have access to a to do/grocery list or even things to look up once you get home to a computer. I don't think a camera would be the best option because it'll drive up costs and open a rabbit whole. People will want quality photos; then you'll have to add a gallery interface and the ability to share/download. Not a step in the right direction; imo.,over 1 year ago,
Beautiful design and wonderful message behind the Light company!If I had to add any preference; it would be adding Bluetooth mainly for the purpose of connecting headphones. Some models require downloading of their apps to use so this would be your opportunity to break into that market by creating some that connect out of the box. Also; with the size/weight of Light 2; it's perfect to take on a run or walk; so that'd be a great feature. Thanks for sharing your vision with the world!,over 1 year ago,
Definitely everyone excited on this! Your first idea was the best for me. The only thing I suggest is Bluetooth and any messages app such whatsapp; signal since this is really significantly important for those who doing business and often travel. Phone call and message significantly expensive when you abroad or even in roaming. Hi. Will you consider to make flip case just like kindle had for this beautiful phone; when you close the lid it off the screen automatically. Good Job light team!,over 1 year ago,
GREAT JOB GUYS!!!,over 1 year ago,Thanks Charlie!! :)
Love the concept. Im curious how you decided on the current size of the phone? I believe the size is even smaller than a iPhone 4. I wonder if a slightly taller device would fit the hand when talking better. Also; when in landscape the messaging interface seems a bit cramped. I would love to hear your thoughts.Cheers!,over 1 year ago,Hi Mike;Thanks!This is a great point we haven't really talked about in this campaign. We chose the dimensions of a credit card because we felt it would fit conveniently into a lot of existing pockets; wallets; etc. We wanted the device to feel invisible in a way. The small size is why we chose to make the keyboard screens landscape; but when landscape it feels comparable to keyboard area on my smartphone.
Great Idea. See a lot of individuals will say if I wanted a dumb phone Id buy one of those brick Nokia phone. I think being able to play music/podcasts via streaming service; directions; uber/lyft/juno; and lastly a voice assistant such as googles will make this phone PERFECT.  Directions via subway/walking are important so your not late to things; being able to call a lyft when you have had a little too much to drink is important. I think all the maybes you have are actually non-negotiables.,over 1 year ago,
This looks awesome; really excited to see it! I have a few questions. First; I'm curious - why the transition to Indiegogo from Kickstarter; from the first Light Phone project? Also; how are you all addressing some of the battery life and performance issues that users reported with the first Light Phone? Thanks!,over 1 year ago,Hi Timothy; Thanks for checking out the project! We ultimately chose Indiegogo because we met the team here in NY and they were very hands on supportive and we liked a few of the backend features for campaigners (metrics and perk/item organization as well as the ways to email backers through our existing support email process). Light Phone 2 is definitely a reaction to shortcoming our the initial phone and we hope to address those issues and more with the new product.
By the way ? Why Android? Android is not really respecting privacy...  is there a way to use a simple OS to be sure that privacy is respected?,over 1 year ago,Leveraging Android was a decision that our software team felt would really make our development much more efficient. The last phone leveraged some Android platform features but ultimately had so many customizations in hardware (unique keypad/small display) that it made software development much more complicated. Android thus far looks like the best option for us; but we'd be open to learning about other OS ideas if you can recommend something; we'd totally explore it.
I also have another question : You said in one of your gif that you'll include a music player maybe a link with spotify?? Is that correct? Can you also include a physical switch to put the phone on silent like iphone? For me a phone like your with a way to listen to music and what you plan ; the perfect phone for me :) What will be the estimate battery lifetime?,over 1 year ago,Hello!One idea was a simple way to play music. Spotify could be one option as a potential partner for making that possible; but we also are conscious of not wanting to force any one platform on our users. It might be a simple way to upload a playlist of your own music; or a platform collaboration; but at this point it is still a hypothetical feature to be discussed with our backers and explored deeper with our development team.  Battery estimate is 5 days standby and a few hours talk time.
I like so much your concept!  What about Plane mode? Reduction of EFM? Is there a way also to plan to try to limit health danger link to EFM Radiation? It could be a great additionnal concept link to a light phone :),over 1 year ago,
Really excited for this. I loved the idea of the first Light Phone; but without messaging I couldnt get behind it. Ive definitely come to a point where I can hate having my phone on me; always feeling the need to check social media. Thats why the Light Phone 2 needs to stay simple. Phone; Text; Alarm; Calandar; Calculator.  A simple calandar too; just for reference purposes. That said; the addition of maps/navigation would be amazing. Just dont know if it belongs on this.,over 1 year ago,Maybe a notepad; too lol!
"What cellular networks will this work on? Is it a ""world phone""? We use a southern USA carrier called cspire. If it will work with our Network I would probably buy 2 for my kids. Smartphones are destroying today's youth...",over 1 year ago,"John; thank you. We have a North America model. It covers LTE bands 2; 4; 12; 13; 17.  I just did a quick googling and it looks like cspire is using 2 and 4; so It should work with your local network no problem. Hope this helps. kai

Thank you for the blazing fast reply! Just to be sure; the light 2 won't be able to send or receive pics right?

We have no plan to enable photos in message. Especially when Eink is such a beautiful black and white display for texts. kai

Thanks again! You should market this to parents trying to shield their kids from the smut tsunami online!!"
"I know whatever features you end up with; you'll upset a group of people who wanted more features or fewer features! I trust you'll make the best choice; whether that is none of your ""maybe"" list; or all of your ""maybe"" list! The only thing I feel really strongly about is having some waterproofing. I feel like part of the disconnect from our normal smartphones would be not thinking about keeping it dry. Hopefully that makes sense! I understand it might be hard; but I think worth it!",over 1 year ago,"P.S. I like the idea of when I'd use it either way; but I would use it a lot more often if it had a wifi hotspot; music player of some kind; and maps! Thanks guys; I love the idea overall!

Eli; thank you for trusting us and so glad that we have your support. cheers; kai"
It would be a nice addition if it had wireless charging,over 1 year ago,
Just pre-ordered a white one. A basic music player please; and what about a really basic note taking app? Also; as someone else mentioned; will black text be visible in low light? A backlight maybe?,over 1 year ago,
Will the white colored phone have the ability to change its display to negative? I much like the white colored Light phone but I'm worried that we won't be able to see the screen in the dark because it's using black text.,over 1 year ago,Brian; we are planning to have front illumination in the eink module so you will be able to see the screen no matter the color. That being said; it's possible to change the background color but I don't think there is need to implement it. Especially we want to make sure the background color matches the color of the frame. Thank you. kai
Great work; not having a car call; text and ride sharing would be perfect for me to replace regular phone and unplug when I got places.,over 1 year ago,
Pre-ordered one of these!  I'm excited to give it a try. I didn't read all comments but a camera with a traditional view finder would be welcomed. I don't know if works with the current design but I think that will be the hardest component to give up.,over 1 year ago,
I contributed a small amount and am thinking of pre-ordering one. One BIG pain point for me though  is the lack of an Internet messaging app. Like many people living abroad; I connect with my family and friends back home through the Internet (e.g. Whatsapp; Messenger or Telegram) because normal calling & texting cost too much internationally. Adding something like Telegram would help solve this problem without allying with any shady conglomerate. Please consider this!,over 1 year ago,Monica; thank you. I can totally relate to that. I use some of the tools to talk to family and friends too. Thanks for suggesting Telegram. Will look it up. kai
I think it should just cover the basics; as in your vision for the device.One way of supporting a limited set of special features (say; a calculator for those who wants one; or the ride/directions for those who wants that) would maybe be to configure a limited number (maybe five?) of web services; pretty much as you would save a webpage as an app In the early days of the iPhone.,over 1 year ago,
To be honest; I'm on the brink of refunding because I'm worried about the performance of the LP2.I want a minimal phone; yes; but that minimalism should be reflected by interface snappiness. However; according to this arstechnica review (http://bit.ly/2I2xyZx); the proposed Snapdragon 2100 won't cut it.Also; the lack of e-ink specs bothers me. What's the refresh rate of the custom panel that you plan to use? How does it handle e-ink ghosting? And how will the frontlight impact the design?,over 1 year ago,"Marc; thank you  and totally understand if our project is too early for you. When I saw the very early demo from supplier last year; the display is pretty crisp to me. We are designing our UI with EInk's limitation in mind. It will be simple and clean and heavily text based; not graphic. Frontlight will inevitably increase the thickness of the phone but it's manageable. Eink will flash so it removes ghosting and we will be sharing videos and photos in the factory so that we keep you posted. kai

Thanks for the quick response; Kai.Do you think you'll be able to grab a video of a working panel before the end of the campaign? I'd really like to keep supporting you guys & pals via this campaign.All the best; Marc

Marc; of course; we will try our best but I am gonna say the chance is low that we are able to share a video in the factory before the end of the campaign. There are several pending contracts and confidentiality agreements we have to go through with vendors. Hope this makes sense. kai"
So if it's possible for you guys can add all the other features onto the device; please do and you won't regret it. It makes the most logical sense because even though the intention to detach from smartphones is appreciated; we still need the essential functionalities that a basic phone should offer in our technologically-advanced and ever evolving society.,over 1 year ago,
Anyway as far as additional features that I'd love to have on the Light Phone 2; all the ones that might be possible (i.e.; directions; ride-sharing; playlist; weather; voice command; calculator; and dictionary) would be preferred for me personally. Those additional features will potentially appeal to those who are on the fence about transitioning from smartphones to this device because they won't be limited to just the basic features.,over 1 year ago,
This device is the future; and I really appreciate your guys' philosophy and approach when coming up with the specs for this phone because today's society is becoming too reliant on smartphones. We don't appreciate the moment and are too glued into a mini-computer that's slowly taking over our lives and making us even less sociable.,over 1 year ago,

"This device to me is the ability to function in today's world but also avoid ""phone addiction"". I love that the features are optional. With that I'd like to see the following as I see them as function not distractions that I would engage with instead of every day life:- Ride sharing (With choice between Uber and Lyft; don't choose for us as some folks feel strongly about using one vs the other. It's not a daily need but would be critical to traveling with the phone outside of my home state).",over 1 year ago,
- Calculator (while seemingly not a daily user; I think a lot of people calculate things like tip often and also phones have completely replaced calculators in my mind so that's why I'd continue to have it)- Simple map/GPS (agree with another commenter about calling business not in our contacts - good for making; changing and cancelling appointments and reservations),over 1 year ago,
- Notes (either voice or not; doesn't matter to me)- Then of course your usual phone; text; phone book features you've includedThings I think consume a lot of time and cause you to disconnect from the world:- Music- Pocasts- EmailWhile I understand this is more a stand alone device this time; do you also have the option to use it as a supplement to another phone?,over 1 year ago,
My phone has replaced me having a camera and I imagine that would be incredibly hard to build into a light phone. Also one of the best things about this phone is the size. I have small hands; phones get bigger by the day; and my hands ache trying to hold; type; swipe on these ever growing devices. Having something I can comfortably hold is something I cannot express my excitement about! This phone will be like a credit card still correct?,over 1 year ago,

"Hi Joe and Kai;I'm so glad you met and developed this product. Lately I've been feeling so addicted to my smart phone; and it was just perfect timing that I stumbled across an article about the Light Phone. I really love the simple design. I can't wait to ditch my smart phone for good!Also; I love your website and ""smartphone ads."" They are hilarious. And so true! Smart phones are sucking up our energy. I really believe in you and your philosophy. Can't wait to see what else you do!-Amanda",over 1 year ago,
Price is not 'Light'!! ):,over 1 year ago,Wonseok;I apologize if the price does not meet your expectation. We are still a small team with limited resource. We don't have corporate's leverage to keep the cost of BOM or R/D low. Majority of the parts and SW will be customized and that's the only way for us to bring our design to life; but at the same time suppliers usually need a minimal order qty for customized components; and that increases our cost. On the bright side; it's difficult for others to copy. hope this makes sense. kai
I think a calculator should be included. Basic time keeping features as well. Phonebook; flashlight (not sure if thats possible); bluetooth for calls and stuff in the car; just a basic calendar so I can see what day it is and the days of the month. Also; just an idea; if you made this phone include tethering you could have it act as a web server as well and serve up a website that includes extra features. I cant think of what those features would be but maybe you can.,over 1 year ago,
Tethering would be; in my mind; a key feature. It's not realistic to think we can disconnect ourselves entirely from the Internet; we're going to have to use it sometimes for whatever reason. In these situations you can tether to your laptop or tablet; take care of business; then turn it off and get back to no connectivity. It's 4G; it should take advantage and include tethering.,over 1 year ago,
After reading through some of these early comments; Ive gotten an idea of what Id like to see and not see. Ive tried to keep in mind the utilitarian philosophy of phone as tool to parse our whats really necessary. Id like to see:- Navigation tools like GPS map/compass- Some way to get a ride; such as Uber/Lyft- Waterproofing- Bluetooth for hands-free calling- NotesMaybe:- Music- EPub reader (the screen is e-ink after all)- Email (such a slippery slope though)- Phonebook?,over 1 year ago,
I believe the Light Phone 2 should have a NANO sim as standard on the device. The device should also have apps such as ;1. Calendar 2. Clock - Alarm *( interface like Bedtime tab on iOS platform) - Stopwatch - Timer - World clock 3. Weather ( will require the 4G data connection) 4. Notes 5. Reminders 6. Voice Memos 7. Calculator 8. Compass 9. Settings10. Music & Podcasts 11. Maps 12. Phone13. MessagesBut these are my opinions so do with it how you please; Good luck to the team.,over 1 year ago,

First and foremost there definitely needs to be a ride-share app and some sort of navigation. I believe these are almost necessities in this day and age. The ability to stream music would also be great; though i would settle for the ability to load a playlist from purchased music. VERY exciting prospect!,over 1 year ago,
Hi;I think everything sounds amazing. My only request is you open sourced your OS.It would be cool if you allow 3d party apps.From the one I need those things:- phone calls - you have it- text - you have it- streaming music (like apple music; or tidal or whatever) - I think it would be nice- ride-sharing app (lyft/uber) - I think you have it.So if you would allow custom apps like music player - that is my ideal phone.,over 1 year ago,
I was happy to contribute. I guess my initial question is regarding the music streaming if its implemented. I exclusively use Tidal; would we have a choice of what service we use?,over 1 year ago,
I've been lurking since the original light phone was announced and I'm beyond thrilled that LP2 is a standalone device. I'm curious what was meant about the playlist feature. I'm hoping it means music streaming as the preparation for manually changing or updating a static playlist would require busy work on a computer. Streaming requires no prep; you just go. That's all I got. I'm jazzed about this project and I'm excited to see it grow.,over 1 year ago,"Jon; thank you. Internally we discussed the possibility of Spotify integration but at this moment we don't want to overpromise backers. We will be doing survey and forum to gather inputs and then decide if music is essential to light phone 2. Hope this makes sense and thank you for your support. kai

Thanks for responding. The possibility of spotify integration was my primary reason to throw cash at the screen. I'll pull for it. Cheers!"
"I could not back this project fast enough! Considering your comment about how you refer to the OS as ""customized toolbox"" internally. This should be a tent pole in your philosophy. NEED vs WANT is subjective; so please allow us to define our own needs. Then the discussion of the intent; purpose; or reasons falls to users. I NEED the texted based OS and simplicity. I still WANT simple news; a reader; geographically based search with ""distance to""; solar charger; bluetooth; voice assistant ...",over 1 year ago,
I would like to see a bare-bones search function for phone numbers. When I'm out; I might need to call a restaurant or store to see if they are open; make a reservation; etc. But they won't be in my contacts. I wouldn't want a full web search; but typing a business name should be possible.,over 1 year ago,"Great point to consider; thanks for bringing it up; Stephen. Glad to have you as a backer :)

I suppose if there is nav function; then there will be access to a database of addresses and businesses. Incorporating a search in the contacts/dialer that leverages that database would be simple.I also want to second another suggestion of waterproofing. Forgetting I have a phone in my pocket might result in me jumping in a swimming pool or running into a rain shower."
I'm Looking for the update of stretch goal. Until now rhe Campaign  is still going strong. Keep it up! But we need to even more boost! I'm following your discussion and reply from all. Very excited to back this project! Recently I have been dissapointed with 5 Indiegogo campaign that I backed up. but when I see your campaign; I just can't resist it. The idea it just too good to be implemented.,over 1 year ago,"Thank you for the kind words and support! So glad you decided to give us a shot after having been burned in the past (we ourselves have been as backers of other projects too; so I know where you are coming from). We have a few stretch goal ideas; seeing as how bluetooth is getting such a strong reaction; we are currently seeing if we can promise that as a stretch goal (if we can actually implement it and what it would take). Thanks again can't wait!!

Hi... I was thinking if you can include flip case for this phone: I would love to have this phone with the magnetic case; just like case for kindle paperwhite; is it possible?

Hello! We do plan to explore some options for cases; but have not really dove into those explorations yet so I cannot say for sure if that exact style of case will be possible and/or something we decide to build ourselves. A few case ideas we have tend to really tie into usecases like maybe a dock that could make the phone a beautiful alarm clock next to your bed or a maybe a rugged case for more risky activities outdoors. That is a great example though and we appreciate you sharing your ideas!"
I have been a big fan of the light phone but wanted more features like sms. The things I think are essential for my dream light phone is something similar to your first option /list but in addition to that please add a simple notes app and a calculator. Thank you for making it as nice and small as the first version.,over 1 year ago,"Thanks for following along. We've heard a lot of feedback from either initial users or interested user about SMS and glad that we found a way to do so that still feels in vein of Light.  Notes although maybe philosophically aligned; I am concerned about screen size. Voice Memos; although maybe not the same for your use case; might be more feasible? Calculator could be a nice touch and I doubt anyone would find that to be a distraction. Thanks for backing! Cheers.

Thank you for the support Millad. Calculator is relatively simple for us to implement but I wonder if it's really necessary in our daily routine. Maybe a survey will give us a good indication. We really like the idea of voice memo too. Instead of trying to type notes on a small eink screen; you can record your thoughts through voice. Hope this makes sense.  kai"
Is there any way to include a notification on the home screen when you press the power button to indicate missed calls; unopened messages?,over 1 year ago,"I do think it is important to show the user missed calls/messages and we will have to find the appropriate way to do so of course.  Other ideas are now possible with E-Ink (*and not at all saying we are going to do this!) but because it uses no energy to display information; only to switch screens;  we could show a notification or abstract indication like a small dot perhaps to let the user know they have missed something without having to hit the power button to check. Maybe that's a bad idea?

Not at all. My Galaxy s8 has a green dot when I have a missed notification; and a red dot for low battery. I love it."
600MHz Spectrum Request - Please Please Please consider adding the capability for 600 and 700 MHz bands to the US Model A.  This will allow users to utilize this device farther from cities and open up your market to customers in rural and remote areas too.

"Adding to the debate about voice controls; perhaps a paired down version of Google Assistant is possible? Similar to bluetooth; I see this as a safety feature; even if the only functionality is ""Call [person]"" while driving.",over 1 year ago,"Hi Ethan; thanks for the input! Voice assistant is definitely going to be an interesting debate as there are many instance where it can be used in light ways perhaps but just as easily can be abused. I think for what you are referring to; we've been informally internally calling ""Voice Command"" vs. ""Assistant"" to clarify its limitation to just: call ___; message___; set alarm for___ like commands... that is of course if we decide it makes sense. Hope all is well!"
@JasonHuebel I hear you; but for some people email is a communication method that requires immediate attention. Even if the emails came in as texts; or some kind of notification; there has to be a way to simply integrate this. I honestly think with email; people can completely drop the smart phone. without; it's just not realistic for a day to day use. You would still need the two phone method which doesn't seem to be the goal here.,over 1 year ago,
"I hate smartphones; and have been nostalgic for the days of simple ""phone"" functionality without all the things that get in the way.  I need my phone to be primarily a phone; an address book is a necessity; and you can't escape from texting these days.  Beyond that; usability is key -- ""buttons"" that are compatible with my clumsy thumbs; and text that is easy to read without having to strain my eyes.  Are there any studies on how the color (black on white; or white on black) impacts this?",over 1 year ago,Also critical is clear sound quality (for normal voice conversations) and reliable signal/antenna.  And better construction quality (aluminum vs. plastic) would be appreciated.  Other features that I think would stay out of my way; but still provide regular benefit; would include directions; alarm clock/timer; calendar; and mp3 player.  I could also see occasional use in a camera and light; but not enough to make these significant feature requests (for me).
Backed; love the vision.Another vote for the ability to pair the device via bluetooth. I consider this a safety feature as well as a feature to meet lawful usage requirements in many areas.For me; the key part of the vision is simple utilitarianism. Any features that keep to that are good. Messaging services outside of SMS do not qualify; secure chat some other way.I would also appreciate the team's fastidiousness toward battery life - part of utilitarianism in my book.,over 1 year ago,"Thanks Jim. Great feedback here and totally understand where you are coming from with Bluetooth. Out of curiosity of battery life expectations - what would make you really excited? (not that it will necessarily be possible but we are curious what our users would be pleased to have). Thanks again for sharing; cheers!

To put a stake in the ground: all-day use of SMS and calls. The pure dream would be for the device to handle a heavy call-centric day (12+ hours) without charging. A device that gives me that kind of freedom from a power outlet while I'm working would be great.

Totally makes sense. Honestly I think it will be tough with current form factor; but that would definitely make it a reliable tool! Perhaps there is another option for those users needing that much battery power of offering a well integrated/designed extended battery case? Disclaimer: brainstorming out loud so maybe that's not a great idea..."
Here are my thoughts about what robbie said below about email... I don't consider email essential to this phone because it lacks the immediacy of phone calls or texting. What do I mean by that?,over 1 year ago,"Phone calls require your immediate attention; obviously. Someone calls; you either pick up right then or you don't. Text messages don't require your immediate attention; but if someone texts you they're trying to get your attention ""soon"". Email; however; is not a communication method that requires you to immediately respond. And if you communicate with email like you would text messaging; a smart phone is probably a priority for you."
"I'd suggest putting serious thought into tethering/hotspot during the LP2 devcycle as a potential LP3 feature; in the hopes of letting LP serve as a raw connection for tablets/laptops/bloatphones without itself having to have every single ""must-have"" app (including some features on the ""maybe"" list; like GPS/directions/maps).  People are already clamoring for LP2 to have every imaginable smartphone feature; maybe this would help draw some lines.Also; I'm strongly *against* any voice control.",over 1 year ago,"I think your point about hotspot; especially as it alleviates the need for all the ""must-have"" apps is a really great point. Thank you for voicing that; as well as your strong opposition to voice control. This will be an exciting conversation for all features to have with everyone. Looking forward!

Thanks; Joe; I figured I'd follow up with a few quick clarifications:1.  I don't like that the ""assistant"" features tend to send recordings back to a central service2. I don't like having the microphone always-on for both power reasons and privacy reasons3. People who work in secure environments (datacenters; government; etc.) might not be allowed such phones.Anway; you might find enterprise customers interested in a ""limited edition""; maybe consider addressing a survey to that topic later?

Thanks for the clarification; I think we are totally on the same page here. Definitely don;t want an always on microphone and have no intention of anything in that nature. Surveys are going to be so helpful for us in working with our backers; pretty exciting stuff so far!"
1. Make an FAQ Update Please. I still don't fully understand the details of this phone. 2. I think Bluetooth is vital (and it is a tool; not a distraction). People need handsfree link for legal issues. You can't talk on your phone in the car in most States now unless it is handsfree.,over 1 year ago,1. Great idea! I can probably put something like that over the weekend or early next week. We're still getting through all of the inbound questions and have already been creating an internal FAQ.2. We don't disagree at all. Our only hesitation was in whether or not we could make it happen within the original  hardware spec. Seeing as there is an overwhelming desire for it is making us realize we might have to find a way regardless. Very glad we have all of you to learn from; thanks!
I think you need the practicality of email. It's not like people are scrolling through it  socially; its a work tool. I would need it more than text messaging. Even if it was very basic. To me; calls; text; and email is all I would even need. The maps and uber is smart too; but I can't be the only one thinking this NEEDS email... Please consider it.,over 1 year ago,
This is going around my mom friends; many of whom are desperate for a reasonably useful; non-addictive phone for kids. What we all need is the ability to track the phone/GPS &  limit texting/calling to approved people; controlled from a parent's phone. Is the functionality a possablity? The kid phone options currently on the market suck; but when I'm sending my kid on a public bus or plane; they need a phone. ALSO will it do real group texting? Group texting on a dumbphone is a nightmare.,over 1 year ago,
Will you be offering a developer kit (LightOS source code; ability to root; any of that kind of stuff)? Absolutely willing to pay a premium for that.,over 1 year ago,Hi Jonathan; Currently do not have plans to do so (mostly because we haven't explored how that would work). That's not to say we won't/can't it just hasn't been something we considered yet. Thanks for the feedback though!
i've been dual carrying a dumb QWERTY phone for call/text and a smartphone in my bag for over a year. the smartphone is now a tablet; wifi only; killed the cell plan. reasons I still the smart phone are- uber- google maps navigation- camerawould love those things; plus maybe a wifi hotspot; or at least a bluetooth data modem for my laptop,over 1 year ago,
"I've been following along with your efforts since the original Light Phone but wanted something that could be a daily phone. Last April I opted for the Punkt MP01 & have been loving the pared down phone experience. In backing your latest iteration; my hope is that you adhere to the idea of ""simple is better"" like you did with the first & do away with nav or a ride share app or a playlist. Part of what I love about the MP01 is that I have to rely more on myself & less on an external tool. Cheers!",over 1 year ago,"Hi Luke; I think you worded that wonderfully; the goal is to challenge everyone to get to that place to ""rely more on myself & less on external tools"". I think that is really where the power lies; and in using the Light Phone that is what has been empowering me. Thanks for keeping the voice of simplicity alive and high priority."
Just want to confirm that the contacts will be synced with my google contacts.I hope...,over 1 year ago,We haven't 100% gotten there; so my answer is not definite; but the goal is to make setting this phone up as seamless as possible and that seems like a logical way to do so (be it google or apple contacts syncing).
Check out https://www.fruber.net/ this is exactly what you are looking for.,over 1 year ago,
I rarely use Uber or Lyft; so this exposes my ignorance; but can't we just CALL Uber or Lyft and setup a ride that way?  Or is it only done through an app nowadays?  This is more a question for others rather than the developers.,over 1 year ago,
"(continued)With all that said; I am still nervous about backing this project. Why? I'm seeing comments here from backers requesting features that aren't on your ""Maybe"" list. For instance; Whatsapp or Signal (which I see Joe endorsed the idea of) should not be added. They duplicate functionality already on the phone (SMS); even if they do offer encryption.Please; stick to your ""Maybe"" list you already in place.",over 1 year ago,"already HAVE in place; that is.

Thanks; Joel. We understand this will be a very delicate balance in that everyone will want different things as their 'essential tools'. I think it is safe to assume that the maybe list is where our head are at and that if other things are implemented it would be; very lightly & optional (if you don't want any messaging on LP2 that could be turned off with a permanent auto-response for instance). Signal and Whatsapp; if ever included; would not look like the apps you know on smartphones (1/2)

But would be more the backend behind the messaging app was what we were thinking. Again; I don't want anyone to worry that we are making a different smartphone and going to add dozens and dozens of features; this is supposed to be a very light experience and the most important feature to us is the time away from the smartphone (being present and not using the Light Phone 2!)."
"OK; I backed the project. I don't normally back electronics projects because they often fail to deliver on their promise (or not at all). With that said; the Light Phone 2 is exactly the kind of phone I'm looking for. I'm tired of ""smart"" phones and their constant nagging for my attention. Looking at the ""Maybe"" column of your potential features; I would like to see Directions; Voice Command (specifically; the ability to dictate text messages) and Calculator.",over 1 year ago,
I've requested a couple of features myself (bluetooth; hotspot); but I do think we all need to be careful of how much functionality we really should push into this awesome concept.  If we want 8+ apps to somehow be integrated as tools into this phone; we may need to consider if we as users should just stick with smartphones.  We can after all just delete many unneeded apps and just use the 8 or so apps that are really useful to us.  Maybe I need to consider it myself too.  Still love this phone.,over 1 year ago,"Thanks Cameron; could not agree more. It's very easy to go down that ""if only it had..."" but the power of the original Light Phone was when you remove those things that you THINK you NEED; and realize that actually without them you are totally fine was quite a self-empowering thing. There are a million excuses we can all make for why we'd take a smartphone over a Light Phone; but in that choice; to understand that being present is most important is really amazing when realized. Thanks for this!"
Very good job. I really excited about your product and can't wait to see it. Only I worried about is CJK language; since your phone supports many Asian contries in Model C. Please consider that.Many people have their needs and asking you more features; but please do not lose your idea for minimalism. Thanks again for the beautiful art.,over 1 year ago,We were hesitant to promise more language support without digging further into what that would require from a development side; but we agree that supporting native languages will be important in making this phone truly international and having the large scale impact we'd love to see.  Thank you so much for the kind words and support! Hope all is well.
I would also like to point out that having things such as Uber and Spotify included in the phone maybe take away from the objective; not to mention some of us (myself included) don't necessarily want applications that infringe on privacy on the phone by default. Maybe have a way to disable/remove functionality (or visa versa to add it in).I do support having a basic music app and an SD card slot though.This is a fantastic idea and I can't wait to recieve the finished product.,over 1 year ago,"Hi Jesse;Sorry if that was not made more clear; but any additional feature will be totally optional! In fact we are calling the operating system a ""customized toolbox"" internally. If you don't want messaging even; one could disable the phone to just be calls like the original Light Phone.  We also want to continue to challenge everyone to understand sometimes the things we think we NEED in terms of features; we actually will be just fine without; life did exist before the smartphones :)"
To all of these people asking for more features; that is not what this is about. Please do not add all of these features,over 1 year ago,"Appreciate your voice Danny and want to assure you that the phone can be as minimal as you'd like it. If there is an added 'taxi' tool to call an Uber/Lyft; it would be an optional install. Personally I don't use those apps on my smartphone anyway and would not include them in my Light Phone 2 ""toolbox""; but I understand that to some users that would allow them to use the Light Phone 2 for much larger chunks of their lives and that is powerful. Again so happy to have you on board; cheers!"
I've seen a lot of feature requests for Whatsapp and Signal here. I think those are essential for this phone; and not having Signal was the limiting factor when I recently tried to switch back to a dumb phone. I don't think that having messaging apps will necessarily take away from the minimalist nature either; afterall there isn't much difference between SMS and Signal from the user's perspective. Additionally; since this is Android; the Signal application takes over the SMS functionality.,over 1 year ago,Thanks; Jesse; for the feedback. I am a Signal user myself on my iPhone and think that encryption and privacy are aligned with the 'light' philosophy. I'm less familiar with Whatsapp but understand it is quite popular; especially outside the US. It is too soon; of course; for me to make any promises; but these are reasonable feature ideas at a high level. We would really want to maintain the 'light' integration in terms of aesthetics in considering these as well.
"I am a little confused as the; ""detailed list of the carriers that will support the Light Phone 2"" says it will support Sprint for the Model A (when you click on ""United States"")... Yet; it does not support any of the 3 bands that Sprint itself supports? <https://www.thelightphone.com/4gcoverage><https://www.phonescoop.com/carriers/carrier.php?c=1>",over 1 year ago,"Joel; thank you very much for bringing this to our attention. That in fact was an error on our part and it does not seem that the Sprint network will be compatible with Light Phone 2. We have updated the site to reflect that. FYI - If in the process; anyone has  backed and it turns out will be unable to use the phone on their intended network; we will be able to offer them a refund prior to shipping; which we think is only fair. It's also possible that we may be able to add more bands.

Thank YOU for the reply.  As the project moves forward; if you find that you are able to add the band(s) necessary to support Sprint; I will buy one faster than you can. . .sprint. . .

Haha! Thanks Joel; I really do hope we can support as many carrier networks as possible."
As I am writing this; you are at 164% of the goal. Well done! We invested because we are excited about your idea. We believe in your vision for this phone. Remember that.

"(continued from previous post)connectivity would be such a welcomed addition.

Any chance of LTE band 2; 4; 12; 71?,over 1 year ago,Hi Dave;We realized there was a typo in the Regions section for Model A. It currently is specced to include 2; 4; 12; 13; 17. (4 was accidentally not included). There is a chance we can squeeze more bands in the phone; but we are trying to be conservative in what is possible. We will need to go through the Radio Frequency testing phase before we will know for absolutely sure what is possible and efficient. Hope that was able to answer your question!
I am really bummed this doesn't include band 4 LTE for the USA. Band 4 is the primary VoLTE band for T-Mobile.,over 1 year ago,Dave; thank you. Our goal is to fully support TMobile network in US. Will try to cover all their LTE bands when we finalize the radio design. We were worry about the potential interference if packing too many bands in our small device. We will keep everyone posted. kai
also;Also; a thought - everyone's use case is going to be different. I personally would have no use for Uber on this; but many others would.

That way; if people want specific tools or have no use for other ones; they can choose what's truly essential for them.,over 1 year ago,"Hi Jonathan;This is great feedback; thank you.

I also would not have a need for Uber; but directions would be helpful to me. Some of our users from the original Light Phone don't want ANY messaging and being able to disable that and even have a permanent auto-reply (i.e. ""I'm sorry I do not receive texts"") is all possible."
This is exactly what I would want in a pocket device - simple; elegant; useful. Enthusiastically backed.Necessary Tools:* For messaging; let the user choose either SMS; Whatsapp; or Signal. * Contacts address book* Full clock (Alarms; Stopwatch; Timer)* Directions* Tether/Hotspot* TOTP Token* Playlist* Calculator,over 1 year ago,
On music: I sympathize w/the desire to include music playback and totally get the complexity of doing so.Versions of Spotify play ads; which feels contrary to the spirit of the device. Conversely; the dominance of streaming means some users may not even have mp3s.Still; I support asking users to do something unusual like import mp3s. It makes music selectionand listeninga more intentional experience. Light could even forge partnerships w/indie artists to include download links at launch.,over 1 year ago,This is very well said; Jack. You nailed it in understanding the complexity of the situation and options we have available. It's true many users might not have mp3s anymore; and on the other side; we'd hate to force any platform like Spotify on our users. I can assure you one thing about ads though; we are completely opposed to any form of advertising on this device. It hits a personal pain point! I always wonder myself what the world would be like if there were no advertising anywhere...
"I enthusiastically backed this; and applaud the desire to reduce a phone to its (modern) essentials!As such: if the goal is to let people ""go light;"" I've already had friends tell me that in 2018; rideshare services are critical. My partner explained this as a safety issue  if she wants to ""go light"" for an evening; she's also going to want to find a way home using Uber/Lyft/etc. Traveling without that option may INCREASE anxiety.Relatedly: will it be backlit to allow reading at night?",over 1 year ago,"Thanks Jack; happy to have you as backer!We've received similiar feedback about ride-share from our initial Light Phone users. They loved taking the phone out for the night; but missed the easy ""escape button straight to home"". Re: backlit; yes! We should update the page to reflect that point as it is important. We for some reason thought it was assumed that we wouldn't make a phone that was not visible at night time; but that was our oversight; thanks for clarifying!"

The musts for me in a tool like this:Phone CallsContacts/Address BookMessaging (SMS; MMS RCS; WhatsApp)Music (Spotify or Google Play Music)CalculatorTap-and-PayBluetooth,over 1 year ago,
Very gladly backed this.  Love to see playlist come to fruition.  Indifferent on most of the other maybes.,over 1 year ago,"Happy to have you too; Justin! Just so you know; we do plan to make all of the tools completely optional. We've been calling it a ""customized toolbox"" so that if there is to be a tool completely irrelevant to you; it would not have to even exist in your phone.  We never saw this as a complete music player; but understand that sometimes one playlist; for me maybe Brian Eno or Steve Reich; can be really helpful in concentrating on work (and not hearing the noise around you in the airport;etc.)."
It's kinda tragic; that we have to argument how to live without a smartphone ... what has become of us; as human beings :-o... LP2 is an awesome idea - happy to support you :-DRegarding the tools and added features: whatever you include; I just hope that it will be possible to turn them off - to preserve batterylife and keep the LP2 as *LIGHT* as possible ;-),over 1 year ago,Yep; totally possible to turn anything off (even messaging; if you want ONLY phone calls); we wish we had made that more clear and are thinking of ways to update the page to reflect that customization.
To everyone asking for a 2FA tool: It probably makes more sense for you to buy a U2F token and use a password manager like 1Password for sites that only support TOTP. This is more secure than using your phone for 2FA.,over 1 year ago,
A little thing I would really appreciate: Automatically delete messages after 1/3/7/30 days. This means I don't have to manage the inbox; while also being an important privacy feature. Since I don't expect Light Phone to implement any security features; it makes sense to minimise personal data lying around.,over 1 year ago,"Thanks; Lukas; that seems like a smart idea. I use that feature on my current iPhone where my messages delete after a week and I love it. We don;t have specifics around security features; but would love to explore what is possible within our capabilities as security/privacy we think are aligned with the 'light' philosophy; but appreciate your kind understanding that at the moment we don't have any plans for that. Cheers!

I trust you will make the right tradeoffs! Thinking about it; I might even get by without storing messages at all; only being able to read a message once. Thank you for the good work~"
I also agree it should have Bluetooth connection; but not a voice assistant. Also; Apple Music and Spotify have to be a must; just adding playlist wont be enough. So the operative system has to be a very narrowed Android Fork. Therefore some Android apps could run on it; just a simple selection for those who would like to install Whatsapp; Telegram or other messaging stuff (under their responsibility).A nice idea would be a desktop or web app to manage the Light Phone!,over 1 year ago,Hi John;We do plan to have a web app to manage the Light Phone; we don't have the exact specifics so we didn't mention it in the campaign but that has been a plan all along. Cheers!
To the team: comments here are a messy place to communicate. Are you preparing a solution to collaborate; discuss and influence the product development?My #1 feature wish: easy hackability,over 1 year ago,Totally agree! We understand that this is not an ideal way to collect feedback and promote organized conversations around possibilities & needs of everyone and plan to have a forum as well as series of surveys that we can synthesize the feedback more constructively. We do love the enthusiasm however and it's great to have all these comments to go through.
Further to my previous comment; as also indicated by others; people in Europe mostly use WhatsApp; rarely SMS any more. However; WhatsApp is to a certain extent a chat program (especially with WhatsApp groups); which can be rather distracting / people to a certain extent constantly use / check because of boredome; hence perhaps not very 'light'.,over 1 year ago,
One way of dealing with feature bloat would be to have the features; but only be able to activate a subset of them at anyone time. For example you might have WhatApp;Signal;SMS but you can only choose one. On top of that a have a total features limit. To stop people constantly swapping features make them stickly for a minimum period.  This way you satisfy the biggest problem of we all want a simple phone but we cannot possibly agree on what that phone should do.,over 1 year ago,This was definitely something we also have considered; a limitation to the number of 'tools' in one's customized 'toolbox'. Regardless of whether or not there is a limit on those; it will be customizable. Ideally this is as minimal as possible for everyone's core needs; which of course will vary greatly between users. It's going to be an interesting balance to solve.
I think it would be good if you could some how get the signal message app this phone.,over 1 year ago,
Love the whole design and concept of the Light Phone 2! E-ink phone; wow. I support people suggesting bluetooth; very practical for in-car usage. Don't bother with the voice assistant; it may stimulate behaviour of grapping phone during conversation when one does not remember some fact. Further; playlist = entertainment = not light. When you include the alarm; could consider having the option to repeat it daily. Futher; please consider the option of only leting it go off on weekdays.,over 1 year ago,Thanks Klaas!Bluetooth is something we'd love to include if possible; but we are not 100% sure it will be possible which is why we didn't include it yet; but we appreciate that everyone is voicing their concerns. Agree about in-car use; it's a safety thing for sure. Playlist is tricky; and thanks for expressing your concerns. For some having some ambient music might help them focus; but it is also entertainment on the other hand and that does not fully align with being light.
I agree with everyone who wants Spotify and directions app included. Otherwise; keep it simple.,over 1 year ago,Thanks Oliver; we agree; simplicity is key and we will never lose sight of that goal!
"I agree with everyone who doesn't want a voice assistant. Bluetooth would be great though. Also: If spotify could be integrated (or a similar service) that would be great too because I don't feel like going back to shuffling MP3 files around.Another thing: It would be great if the directions ""app"" would include public transportation data. In many countries those should be available through open (and free) APIs.",over 1 year ago,"I personally agree regarding voice assistant too. When we included voice commands on the maybe list of features; we were thinking simple ""Call Mom"" ; ""Message Rachel"" like simple commands; not ""Hey Google; what's the capital of..."" or ""Alexa order me some more..."" or whatever you do with those voice assistants (personally never used them maybe obvious from my examples lol).The directions app will inevitably rely on open and free APIs. Being a frequent user of public transportation; I agree."
I like the idea and I love the long time the campaign gives to listen to feedback and improve the product.As said by others; Bluetooth is a must for safety in the car. I would considered a stripped down version of WhatsApp or Telegram too (I live abroad and SMS are not free).Waiting for the forum!,over 1 year ago,Thanks Davide! The forum is going to be really fun; I can already tell from the comment section.
"What an amazing idea and design; but please; no voice integration; no web ""services"" to mine and sell your data. Alexa will serve you ads. Google will harvest your data. Keep it simple please. Telephone; messages; simple directions; maybe onboard music. This phone will be brilliant and defined by what it doesn't have; be brave!  Also will it be possible to use this phone without a gmail account if its based off android.",over 1 year ago,Hi James; thanks for keeping the voice of simplicity as high priority. We are fundamentally opposed to data collection and advertising and would do nothing that would compromise that. No Gmail account will be required to set up this phone; but thank you for bringing that point up. Cheers; Joe
I am stoked for this idea! I watched the campaign for Light Phone and let it pass me by. I want to pick up a strictly work phone to separate it from my personal phone. My only thing Id like to add is an earlier ship date!!!! Can we get this for my Birthday? OCT 29th? Maybe it will prevent me from buying the next iPhone! ??,over 1 year ago,
I had read somewhere that Alexa integration was in the works at some point; and I think it would be a great addition.  Alexa can be used to access spotify and other services without them bloating everything up probably.  I'd love spotify on this thing; but I don't feel like the current mobile UX would be right given the mission of this device.,over 1 year ago,
Please; please; please do NOT include a voice assistant with this. 2FA is an excellent suggestion as is Bluetooth though; personally; 2FA is more important. WiFi (and thus a hotspot I assume) plus WhatsApp integration gets me everything needed for international travel. If GPS is included; what about related info such as coordinates and altitude; plus compass headings? If a calculator is included (which I like); might as well include conversions. Can contacts be imported or is manual entry req'd?,over 1 year ago,
I'm probably in the minority here; but since this is an e-ink device; I would love to be able to read books on it. I know; however; that there are several platforms for that that you would have to consider including; and that that introduces additional complexity.,over 1 year ago,
Backed up this project because this is a truely beautiful vision I need to see be made into a reality. Thank you so much for all the hard work to make our lives lighter. Everything you intend to intergrate into the phone is great and I believe that BLUETOOTH is necessary for it to be utilized as a phone in todays world. This will alow users to connect the phone to all of their other tools like their cars; earphones; speakers and more. Thank you so much for your time!,over 1 year ago,Having a playlist and bluetooth is something we all use 24/7. Nothing else needs to be added. If anything else is added then it defeats the purpose.This is an 18yr old talking and I cant stand that our phones have become our center. This phone should serve our NEEDS not WANTS.
Bluetooth would be very nice; Spotify would be a good second tier request; as would nav and hotspot. That's really it for me; that would be functional enough and still maintain the minimalism and simplicity I'd be after.Interface question - is there a plan for lock screen/pocket-dial protection? I might've missed it in the read-through.,over 1 year ago,
I agree with Justin; too many people already defying the whole concept by requesting things that they have on smart phones. KEEP IT SIMPLE!!!! Love it guys!!,over 1 year ago,
Absolutely love everything about this!  You have really nailed it with the simplicity; from the physical design to the feature set.  I will buck the trend and suggest you DON'T add more features.  Clock/Alarm; phone and sms are the PERFECT minimalist tools (music and directions are fine; too; I suppose - but anything else is really too much). And thank you also for making it a monochrome e-ink display!  My eyes are grateful.,over 1 year ago,Justin; thank you so much for the kind words and feedbacks. I love grayscale eink display too. No hideous blue light..kai
Please add bluetooth guys; with headphones at cars; its really a no brainer if you want this to be functional. Obvi directions and rideshare would be great too,over 1 year ago,Cliff; thank you. We are not be able to promise BT at the moment but this is something we are considering. We will know more about the impact on spaces and cost when we officially kick off suppliers. thank you kai
This is a dream come true. You guys are helping design a better culture; and with style too.+1 directions+1 music+1 hotspot+0 anything else (although a developer model could get interesting),over 1 year ago,Thank you. Couldn't do this without you and everyone else's support. kai
I just backed.  I don't need a lot of features; to me that is the whole point of this phone.  I would just like two: 1) Bluetooth - in my state you get a ticket if you use a phone while driving. 2) Calculator - Just a basic one.  Thanks for a great idea.,over 1 year ago,Thank you for the feedbacks. Much appreciated. kai

I downgraded to a flip phone many moons ago but find myself still using my old iPhone for the following:1) ride share service for work related travels (lyft);2) navigation w/ google maps in and out of country;3) music in the car via bluetooth (playlists are from iTunes); and4) weather and surf reportPleased to back this!  Thanks so much for making this step.,over 1 year ago,
Any thoughts on including a basic calendar? I think it's important to get away; but sometimes you need to know how long you've been wandering.,over 1 year ago,
Just backed - super pumped for this.::Must haves::- Need to be able to use this interchangeably with my smart phone (call / text forwarding or being able to swap out the sim card) this loses it's value to me if it has to be a separate phone #.- GPS Directions.

"I'm reading a few comments that ask for Google assistant or a voice assistant. I think that might be getting away from the whole purpose of a ""light"" phone. Definitely adding some sort of music functionality to the phone would increase it's usability for me. maybe some sort of support for Spotify or Google play music. Or maybe even something as basic as Pandora radio. But at the least; it should be able to store a playlist for the gym.",over 1 year ago,
I would second two ideas: 1) Google Assistant and 2) Bluetooth. I think incorporating Google Assistant would open this up to a lot of people. Bluetooth would just be nice.,over 1 year ago,Clarifying the idea on Google Assistant. I was thinking an indicator light similar to what you see on Google Home. This way you could still be notified by the Light about reminders; calendar appointments; etc. Personally; this makes it even lighter for me as I would then rarely; if ever carry a smart phone; but everyone will have different opinions as well. No matter what; am excited for this product.
Just backed it. However; I did so assuming this would be the same forwarding situation as the first model. I do not have the ability to permanently switch from my iPhone; but want the ability to tune out while still being reachable. I really hope that forwarding becomes a reality for this phone in the same way that it was for the first one.,over 1 year ago,
Its got most of the stuff; i thought could be added to Light phone 1.0 I have; quite happy to back this.,over 1 year ago,
It sounds like this could be used as a replacement for a smart phone should one choose; which I am considering.  I'm curious what the service structure looks like.  Did you team with another provider's 4G network?  What is the cost/month of the service?  Is there a contract?  Must all backers use the light phone network; or could it be piped through another; say Verizon?,over 1 year ago,
"I would like these things in a basic phone:- Calls; obviously :)- SMS (whatsapp would be great though; if treated like regular sms)- Contacts/address book- Alarms + clock- Internet sharing- Email; I know this is not something you like; but for me some emails are business criticalThe rest; like ""ride-sharing""; directions; playlist/music; weather etc; I see as superfluous luxury.It looks like a great phone; still; though :)",over 1 year ago,Oh; and touch compatibility with any gloves; like the old Nokia Lumias. But that could be asking too much ;)
I have tried time and again to ditch the smartphone. The Light Phone 2's perfect balance of utility and design may finally allow me to follow through.Are there plans for a developer model? As a software developer I would love to be able to tinker with this phone. I think it is important that releases remain in your control; but curated community fixes and tweaks could also be included. It could lead to faster releases; greater adoption; and maybe save you some money too.,over 1 year ago,Torin; thank you for the kind words.  To be honest we haven't thought about a developer model but I think it's really interesting. Will keep it in mind. kai
I don't understand this. This is a minimalist phone; not one that will replace your smart phone. All these request are outright ridiculous. Please developers DON'T ADD ANY MORE FEATURES. Thanks.,over 1 year ago,Hi Ruben; thank you for the feedback. kai
+1 Two Factor (Thanks Howard Mann for thinking about 2FA and commenting!)  Please consider partnering with Duo for a comprehensive solution:https://duo.com/partners,over 1 year ago,
Just backed! I'd love this to completely replace my phone; that being said I think maps would be pretty essential for traveling. My only other ask would be to make it durable; so many of todays phones are too fragile. Good luck; guys!,over 1 year ago,Thank you for the support Matthew. Much appreciated.
It'd be great if this device could seamlessly integrate most popular chat apps ex: WhatsApp; messenger; sms all in one. Dunno if it's possible; but would be nice.,over 1 year ago,"Hi Irfan; this is probably out of our initial scope at the moment but we remain really interested in exploring whatsapp. It seems essential to international users. kai

WhatsApp support would be huge! I think y'all have a fantastic product in the making :)"
Sounds awesome! Please don't add voice command #techtoofar. I would like to see integration with Spotify though. Bluetooth would be a valuable addition to the hardware too. Would be nice to be able to wirelessly stream music in my car.,over 1 year ago,"Personal hotspot would be nice too.

+ Podcasts

Thank you David; we cannot promise BT just yet but music is something we discussed a lot internally. We want to encourage people to go light longer or for good. Music seems to be really critical for some. cheers  kai"
There is one extra feature that would let me use this phone as an only phone and not a second phone: a two-factor authenticator like google authenticator. Please consider it.,over 1 year ago,Thank you. but not sure I understand the purpose of this feature? can you elaborate? kai
I have been dreaming of an E-ink phone that just does calls and texts. I am so excited for this!,over 1 year ago,Thank you for the support. We are very excited too! Cant wait to really bring it to life as soon as we can.  cheers; kai
This is brilliant! I recently started an open source project called Embrace Clarity(open source hardware and software). Have a look it might inspire you; especially the modular OS concept where apps dont exist. There is a rough white paper and an early version of the UI Kit on GitHub.

Thank you so much for doing this; beyond excited to see the final product!+1 for maxed-out battery; hot-spot; rideshare; music.,over 1 year ago,Rick; thank you for the kind words. Couldn't do this without you and everyone else's support. Feedbacks noted too. kai
I will most definitely back this project (or buy one) if the Model A for USA supports more than just Bands 2; 4; 12; 13; and 17...  As a Sprint user; this makes me :(Do you think support will be added for Bands 25; 26; or 41?,over 1 year ago,Joel; thank you. It's unlikely we are able to add more bands to ModelA. I apologize. kai
Just a heads up the Light Phone 2 - Couples (2) shows an Indigogo receipt with only 1 phone on it (not 2). I presume that was just a simple oversight but was just hoping to get confirmation of that fact. It shows the following as a receipt: 1 x Light Phone 2Color: black1 x Charging Cable,over 1 year ago,"Joseph; I apologize for confusion. We set it up inaccurately and already have it fixed. Will make sure we correct your order internally. kai

No worries! I can't wait to see this thing come to fruition; it's an excellent idea. Excited to see the forum go up so I can read the progress."
I didn't see this mentioned in the project specs (maybe it was and I missed it) is the phone planned to have lighting in the screen? E-ink is awesome I love it on my kindle; but without backlighting the phone would be impossible to use in the evening,over 1 year ago,"Robert; thank you. We do plan to add front illumination to the E-ink module. You can change the brightness and be able to see the screen during daylight or in complete dark. Exact UI on lighting control is TBD but we will keep everyone posted. Thank you. kai

Sounds perfect! The next year to get this phone can't come soon enough"
Are you considering bluetooth capability; for either an earpiece or to link to an external speaker (for music)?  There is a law in my state (which I support) that talking + driving must be done hands free.,over 1 year ago,Hi Cameron; thank you. We are considering it. But again we don't want to promise BT just because we are not sure if we have enough room in the phone for BT antenna. We will know more later when we officially kick off our ODM suppliers. Will let you know. kai
+1 hotspot+1 rideshare+1 directions+1 for signal,over 1 year ago,Appreciate all of the feedback! We will do our best to keep answering in the comments; but we expect to create a forum and series of surveys so we can better synthesize and organize the conversations. Love the enthusiasm so much though; thank you all for the support!
Alexa integration(via AVS) could a be a great addition as well.,over 1 year ago,
"Hey Kaiwei; Joe and fellow backers;First of all; I'm very intrigued by LP2's concept. Now; being a designer myself; I'm quite reluctant when it comes to active user participation (""design by committee""); but in this particular case I think it's of utmost important to discuss design decision with everyone involved. Like; serious discussion; no ""I want feature X; cuz"" one-liners.I consider my backing as an $285 investment in quality discussion about the future of phones and digital services.",over 1 year ago,"So here's my question: Do you guys/pals plan to setup a forum or something? Or how would you want people to participate in this project?

Marc; thank you for the note. We would love to hear everyone's inputs and are indeed planning to have a place for discussions. Not sure what format yet but will keep you posted. kai"
Pre-ordered two!Lots of great ideas in the comments. +1 for the mobile hotspot; music player; maps and unicode support (in that order).I wouldn't mind going past the 6mm thickness mark for more battery either.,over 1 year ago,Thank you for the feedbacks. Much appreciated. kai
"I'm so excited for this phone. 2 days ago I literally googled the term ""e ink phone no internet""with no results; but today I find out that you have read my mind. I currently use a dumb phone; and the 2 biggest gripes I have are that I don't have maps/directions and don't have music services. It would be amazing to have those features. Also please include full unicode support in texting. Having any text message with an emoji show up on my current phone as ""?"" is tough in 2018",over 1 year ago,"Thanks Robert; amazing coincidence! Thanks for pointing out about unicode support; we will have to consider that in our explorations as well.

Thanks it would be great because nowadays tons of people just send an emoji to respond to things or to show the emotional context of the text and without that displaying correctly it can be very very hard to figure out what is being said

That makes total sense. In a similar vein; we are still not sure how exactly will be the best way to handle group messages also. We have a few ideas and will be bouncing those off of our backers as the campaign ends and development really picks up in pace."
LOVE this idea.  I saw the email notification and bought it completely on emotion; but I'll ride that wave for at least a year.Totally second (or third/fourth) hotspot.  There are times when I simply have to have an app for the type of work that I'm engaged in.  However; if I can use an ipad for those must-have apps (only when needed) tethered to the internet via the lightphone; well that would just solve every problem in my life.  I would reward you with a plate of my wife's homemade cookies.,over 1 year ago,Thanks Cameron! That example makes sense and to me doesn't seem to contradict the idea of being 'light'. Appreciate everyones feedback a lot. We will have more formal ways to get everyone's opinions more thoroughly documented once the campaign is complete through updates with our surveys and forms. Cheers!
Love this. In the US; having text; calling; Maps and Rideshare (Lyft or Uber) is a good enough package for me! Maps and Rideshares are practically the only reason I can't just stick with a dumbphone.Outside the US though; most people use WhatsApp instead of text; FYI; so you may want to consider that.,over 1 year ago,Thanks Raj! Glad our paths crossed. That's a great point about international texting in What'sApp; will have to explore and learn more from our users; but thanks for pointing that out.
Very excited! My list of would-like-to-have's includes phone; text; alarm; ride sharing (would it be just one company; or multiple? wouldn't want to be tied to just Uber; usually prefer Lyft; but would be nice to have options); playlist (also curious how this would work -- would it be connected to an existing service like Spotify; or standalone? how would you get music files onto the Light 2? could it handle podcasts?); and directions (would this be GoogleMaps or another service?).,over 1 year ago,"Hi Abigail;Thanks for feedback! As for ride-sharing; we are not sure yet; we would hate to limit to one company and ideally would have an option; but that is subject to our ability to build the app that works with them (may require their participation). Playlist is similiar to ride-share in that it could be as simple as an ""mp3 player"" with a way to drag your own songs on; or maybe a partnership with a Spotify; but again we hate to force a platform onto our users. (1/2)

Directions; like ride-sharing; would require a collaboration and GoogleMaps seems like a reasonable option with lots of support for third parties already in place. I hope that was able to answer some of your questions.!

Thank you; yes that answers my questions. :)"
+1 for mobile hotspot. If that's included I would be in without hesitation. I have to think on this for a bit otherwise. I hope it comes to fruition - phone / concept is pretty much perfect.,over 1 year ago,Stu; thank you. Totally get it. We just cannot promise you now until we know better when we kick it off officially with suppliers and get an idea of how much development capital we have. Hope you understand. kai
I am so excited about the Light II; when anyone ask me about my original Light have always said. if they would make this with texting; music; & possibly GPS I would no longer need my iPhone. I have one question after reading other comments and reading all the info you've provided. So even if I use my SIM card from my iPhone; I won't receive text? I have to get another number for texting? Or am I just confused (high possibility). Keep designing beautiful and functional tools! Thank YOU!,over 1 year ago,"Hi Mitch;Thanks so much for supporting our original phone as well! Sorry that it gets confusing with how it will work and we will try our best to clarify everything in future updates; we wanted to not overwhelm the main campaign page.  If you used the actual SIM from your smartphone; it would work as normal in the Light Phone 2 (getting texts and all); however you cannot forward texts from the smartphone SIM to a second SIM in the Light Phone 2 . Hope that makes sense! Cheers; Joe

Awesome! Thank you so much! You guys rock!!

Hi Mitch; so glad that you like Light II! and thank you for supporting us. Sorry if we didnt make it clear on the page. But you will definitely be able to receive and send text. We are also planning to offer a simple plan through Light; for users who wants a cheaper plan to pair with Light II's functionalities. Will have more to share soon. Thanks again. kai"
Guys; I am very excited and can't wait to see the final product.I didn't buy the Light Phone however; I am happy that I ordered Light Phone 2.Only request; keep the phone as similar as the pictures hate to see the metal/aluminum casing.Wish you all the best and super excited!,over 1 year ago,Hi Naveen; thank you for the support. As we did for Light Phone 1; we will try everything we can to keep the design as is. Different manufacturing process can help us with the color matching on Aluminum (i.e. Anodizing). We will keep everyone posted during the development stage as well. Thanks again. kai
"Three things...Could an option be added to forgo the inclusion of a charging cable? I've fully converted over to USB-C and don't want/need another cable that will sit in a drawer; unused. Keep the price the same; I simply don't want to add one more cable to e-waste.What limitations prevent a ""universal"" phone as being a 4th option; a.k.a. supporting each of the 3 regions outlined in the Story? That would make it perfect for traveling internationally sans smartphone.+1 to the hotspot idea.",over 1 year ago,"Hi Luke; thank you. I am sorry but It's unlikely we can ship phone without charging cable. But it also depends on how we design the final packaging.;.When it comes to mass production; we want to keep the assembly process standard so it's more efficient and avoid issues..but will keep your suggestion in mind.It's the limited space in the phone to prevent the interference of different 4G frequencies. Also cost of testing; redesigning and making all bands work..Hope it makes sense. Thanks. kai

Regarding the charging cable bit; I work in logistics so the thought had crossed my mind that it would impact final assembly/inventory control. I have no experience in this sort of supply chain but I can appreciate not introducing any more complexity than necessary. Hence my desire for this phone. As for 4G clarification; makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain."
One brilliant idea; maybe a very distinctive approach; but can be entirely done modifying the launcher: make the whole phone a Google Assistant device; to use Assistant for calls; texts; translation; directions; alarm; calculations; weather; controlling lights etc. That would be truly minimal.,over 1 year ago,Hi Saurabh; thank you. This is very interesting. We will take a look. kai
Hey! I'm absolutely smitten with this idea. So excited that SOMEONE is thinking outside the shiny glass box. I just have a question before I take the plunge with you guys: when you say the battery is good for a few hours of talk time; what exactly do you mean? I just need to know if it will make it through a full day without a recharge. Can it handle a typical amount of texting and maybe a phone call or 2? Thanks so much!,over 1 year ago,HI Sam; thanks for the kind words. Much appreciated. One of our priorities in Light Phone 2 is to improve the battery life and make sure it has a 5~7 days stand by and definitely can make a day without recharge. The trade off is that we will have to increase the thickness from 4.8mm (Light Phone1) to potentially 6mm. But i really think it's worth it. Especially for Light Phone 2's usecase. Thank you. Kai
Sounds like no NFC to use with tap and go payments?  I'd be interested in hearing more about the  playlist app and how that might sync to podcast feeds; or is that something still in the design phase?,over 1 year ago,Hi Right Click;Thank you. We are not sure if we have enough space for an NFC module at the moment and it doesn't seem to be one of the essential features from our conversation with users. But definitely interesting; will keep everyone posted when we finalize our spec. Thanks again. kai
Please include Hiya scam; spam; and call blocking capabilities:https://hiya.com/partners,over 1 year ago,"Interesting! Thanks for sharing; Brad. It is suggestions like this that are the reason we chose to launch the campaign this early in the development process. Looking forward to continuing to work with our backers.

It really works; makes life better.  Simpatico with the Light Phone's goals."
What's the rationale for losing the ability to use the same number as the core smartphone? Needing to have two numbers adds a lot of cost and complexity. I would be curious to hear solutions on how to utilize LP2 as a companion device more seamlessly.,over 1 year ago,"Hello! Thank you for bringing this up; it's something that we have been thinking about the entire time. Unfortunately due to the larger landscape of the telecom world; there is no way for us (as Light or as users) to provide a universal solution to keeping the same phone number. We were able to do so with phone calls with our initial Light Phone through our unique cloud platform; however; even that platform is limited to phone calls because of carrier restraints. (1/2)

Fortunately many carriers; and partially due to the coming of more smartwatches with SIMs; are working to solve this problem in a way that only they are capable of doing. We expect this is how many of our users will be able to make the Light Phone 2 a  seamless extension of their smartphone.  Other options include call forward; auto-reply messages and actually owning the second unique number as one's 'light number' and sharing that with friends/family.

Thanks for the reply! Excited to test it out.

One additional thought. So the idea of having a 'light number' could work - but the issue would be that friends/family wouldn't necessarily know when I'm in 'light mode'. One solve could be to have LP2 be the call forwarding phone; with an easy toggle; so when it's off or unused it'll forward to smartphone; and friends/family know to always use the LP2 number."
Hi there. I don't yet own a Light Phone-- I was very interested in the 1st gen model. Reading this now I am extremely disappointed that this is no longer designed to be used as a second phone. To me; the whole point was that there was no need for a second phone number. Can someone please explain the reasoning behind this shift?I really just want to buy the original phone...,over 1 year ago,Hi Romona; Thanks for reaching out. Firstly; we do plan to continue to make the original Light! Also; this phone is simply a wonderful simple phone in our opinion and can be a 'only' or 'second phone' for our users depending on their needs. We cannot; because it out of our control due to carrier restraints; keep your same phone number for messaging on this new phone. The original Light Phone being limited to calls was able to do this. I hope that was able to clarify!
I paid $1 to make this comment; so I really hope to get a response:1) $250 is pretty high considering I can get a flip phone for $100 2) Would love to see hotspot pairing before I back it 3) Please add hotspot I really want this after falling in love with lightphone 1,over 1 year ago,I understand that $250 is not the cheapest phone around; but it is the reality of our small scale and highly customized phone. Hotspot is an interesting idea; one that we would be open to exploring; but like the other potential tools; we cannot guarantee it will possible or available when the phone ships. We appreciate your feedback (and the $1 to make this comment - you can also always email us at support@thelightphone.com ) Cheers!
Absolutely love the new light phone. Wished I had the first; happy I'm here for the second. I'd personally love to see mobile hotspot on this phone. I can easily see myself ditch my current phone and use theLP2 exclusively; provided I can tether to my laptop wherever I am (for emails; work; and the occasional social media binge).Is this possible? If Light OS is Android based; maybe you can pull in the hotspot modules?,over 1 year ago,Hotspot is an interesting idea; one that we would be open to exploring; but like the other potential tools; we cannot guarantee it will possible or available when the phone ships.  Indeed it is running Android at its core and the module you mention is something we can probably use as well. Thanks for understanding and for supporting our project; Joey. Cheers!
"Not so ""light;"" but frontside illumination to be able to read the e-ink in a dark room would be nice to have (could be off by default; toggled via a key combination). Not a dealbreaker -- I'm potentially OK with having to go find a lamp.",over 1 year ago,Laxg; thank you. We do plan to add front illumination to the E-ink module. You can change the brightness and be able to see the screen during daylight or in complete dark. Exact UI on lighting control is TBD but we will keep everyone posted. Thanks again.
