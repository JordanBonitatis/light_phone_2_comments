# light_phone_2_comments
## About
This is a small python script to fetch comments from the Light Phone 2 Indiegogo project.<br/>
It allows backers to attempt to look up answers before pestering the project creator.<br/>
Could be modified for other projects.

## To Run
Clone the project then `cd` into it.
`python ./light_phone_comments.py`
This will generate a `csv` file that you can `grep` or open with Excel and easily browse/search comments.<br/>
 
## Dump
You may notice that this project also includes a CSV file. I added it here so its available if you don't want to run the script yourself. If the CSV is current enough, you can just grab it and begin searching/grepping it right away.
